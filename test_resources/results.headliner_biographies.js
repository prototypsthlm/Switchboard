"text": "For the American southern gospel singer, songwriter and guitarist see Jacky Jack White  Jack White (born John Anthony Gillis on July 9, 1975 in Detroit), American rock musician, producer, and actor. He is best known as the guitarist and lead vocalist of the rock duo The White Stripes (1997-2011) and more recently guitarist and vocalist of The Raconteurs, and drummer and vocalist for the band The Dead Weather.  Jack White first played as a professional musician in the early 1990s, as a drummer for the Detroit cowpunk band Goober & the Peas. White produced Loretta Lynn's Van Lear Rose in 2004, which won them a Grammy for best country album, and an additional Grammy for best country collaboration for the song Portland Oregon.    The Love Interruption Songfacts reports that his debut solo single, Love Interruption, was made available on January 30, 2012 at White's pay-to-join club Vault and at Jackwhiteiii.com. A week later, it was released on the singer's preferred format, vinyl. It was produced by the ex White Stripe and recorded at his own Third Man Studio in Nashville along with its exclusive non-LP B-side Machine Gun Silhouette. This was followed by his first solo album, Blunderbuss, later in 2012, and an accompanying tour. This is not said to indicate an end to either the Raconteurs or the Dead Weather.  His blaring guitar solos and ability to pull sound from the simplest of \"instruments\" are his greatest strengths along with his desire to partner with female vocalists.  He currently resides in Tennessee. He announced his divorce in 2011 from wife since 2005, fellow musician Karen Elson, and they have two children. Third Man Records (White's label) and Elson's clothing boutique are also located there.  Last.fm Group: http://www.last.fm/group/Blunderbuss",

"text": "Jack White (n√© Gillis), often credited as Jack White III, is an American musician, singer, songwriter, record producer, multi-instrumentalist and occasional actor. He was best known as the vocalist, guitarist and pianist of The White Stripes until they split in February 2011, as well as a vocalist and guitarist for The Raconteurs and the drummer of The Dead Weather. White released his debut solo album, Blunderbuss, on April 24, 2012. He is ranked No. 70 on Rolling Stone's list of \"The 100 Greatest Guitarists of All Time\". White's popular and critical success with The White Stripes enabled him to collaborate as a solo artist with other renowned musicians, such as Beck, The Rolling Stones, Jeff Beck,Alicia Keys, Bob Dylan, Electric Six, Insane Clown Posse, and Loretta Lynn, whose 2004 album Van Lear Rose he produced and performed on. In 2006, White became a founding member of the rock band The Raconteurs. In 2009, he became a founding member and drummer of his third commercially successful group, The Dead Weather. He was awarded the title of \"Nashville Music City Ambassador\" by the Nashville mayor Karl Dean in 2011. \n\nEarly life:\nOf Polish, Scottish, and Canadian descent, John Anthony Gillis, the son of Teresa and Gorman Gillis, was born the youngest of ten children (six brothers, three sisters) in a lower middle-class neighborhood in Detroit, Michigan. He grew up in a Catholic family. His father and mother worked for the Archdiocese of Detroit, as the Building Maintenance Superintendent and secretary in the Cardinal's office, respectively. White eventually became an altar boy, which landed him an uncredited role in the 1987 movie The Rosary Murders, filmed mainly at Holy Redeemer parish in southwest Detroit. As a child he was a fan of classical music. He attended Cass Technical High School in Detroit. He began playing an instrument, a drum, at the age of six. As a teenager, White was already listening to the blues and 1960s rock that would influence him in The White Stripes,Son House and Blind Willie McTell being among his favorite blues musicians. He and his childhood friend, Dominic Suchyta (NKA Dominic Davis), would listen to records in White's attic on weekends and began to record cover songs on an old four-track reel to reel tape machine. At the time White was described as \"a kid with short hair and braces\". He has said in many interviews that Son House's \"Grinnin' In Your Face\" is his favorite song of all time. In 2005 on 60 Minutes, White told Mike Wallace that his life could have turned out differently. \"I'd got accepted to a seminary in Wisconsin, and I was gonna become a priest, but at the last second I thought, 'I'll just go to public school. I had just gotten a new amplifier in my bedroom, and I didn't think I was allowed to take it with me.\" At 15, White began a three-year upholstery apprenticeship with a family friend, Brian Muldoon. White credits Muldoon with exposing him to punk music and pushing him to play music with Muldoon as a band: \"He played drums, well I guess I'll play guitar then.\" The two recorded an album, Makers of High Grade Suites, as The Upholsterers. White later started a one-man business of his own, Third Man Upholstery. The slogan of his business was \"Your Furniture's Not Dead\" and the color scheme was yellow and black--including a yellow van, a yellow-and-black uniform, and a yellow clipboard. Although Third Man Upholstery never lacked business, White claims that it was unprofitable, because of his complacency about money and his business practices that were perceived as unprofessional, including making bills out in crayon and writing poetry inside the furniture. Shortly thereafter, White landed his first professional gig, as the drummer for the Detroit band Goober & the Peas. He also played in other local bands and did solo shows. \n\nRecording career:\n\nThe White Stripes:\n\nWhite formed The White Stripes in 1997, along with Meg White, The band began its career as part of the Michigan garage rock underground music scene, playing with local bands such as Bantam Rooster, The Dirtbombs, The Paybacks, Rocket 455, and The Henchmen, among others. In 1998, The White Stripes were signed to Italy Records, a small and independent Detroit-based garage punk label, by Dave Buick. The band released its self-titled debut album in 1999, and a year later the album was followed up by the cult classicDe Stijl. The album eventually peaked at No. 38 in Billboard's Independent Albums chart when the band had established their popularity. While performing and in music videos, Jack and Meg are very recognisable visually, as they dress only in red, white, and black. In 2001 the band released White Blood Cells. The album's stripped-down garage rock sound drew critical acclaim in the UK and soon afterward in the US, making The White Stripes one of the more acclaimed bands of 2002. The album was followed up in 2003 by the commercially and critically successfulElephant. Allmusic wrote that the album \"sounds even more pissed-off, paranoid and stunning than its predecessor ... darker and more difficult than White Blood Cells. \" The album's first single, \"Seven Nation Army\", was the band's most successful. The band's fifth album, Get Behind Me Satan, was recorded in White's own home and marked a change in the band's musical direction, with piano-driven melodies and experimentation with marimba and a more rhythm-based guitar playing by White. The band's sixth album Icky Thump, released in 2007, entered the UK Albums Chart at number one and debuted at number two on the Billboard 200. The album's sound also included more punk, garage and blues influences than its predecessor. In late 2007, the band announced the cancellation of 18 tour dates due to Meg White's acute anxiety problems. White had revealed plans to release a seventh, as of yet untitled album in the summer of 2009. However, this has yet to happen. The band also made their first live appearance since Meg's anxiety problems in September 2007 on the final episode of Late Night with Conan O'Brien on February 20, 2009. A documentary, The White Stripes: Under Great White Northern Lights, about the band's 2007 tour, in which they played a gig in every Canadian province and territory, appeared in the 2009 Toronto International Film Festival. In July 2007, The White Stripes made history by playing the shortest concert ever only playing one note, in St John's, Newfoundland. They played a full show later that night at the Mile One Centre in downtown St. John's. On February 2, 2011, it was reported on the main page of whitestripes.com that the duo has decided to part ways. White stated that it was not due to health issues or artistic differences but there were a \"myriad of reasons\". \n\nThe Raconteurs:\nWhite formed The Raconteurs in 2005 along with Brendan Benson, Jack Lawrence and Patrick Keeler. The origin of the band was the song 'Steady, As She Goes' which White wrote along with Benson. This inspired them to create a full band with the addition of Lawrence and Keeler. The band came together in Detroit during 2005 and, for the remainder of the year, recorded when time allowed. The band's debut album Broken Boy Soldiers was recorded at Benson's home in Detroit. The band set out on tour to support the album, including eight dates as the opening act for Bob Dylan. The group's second album, Consolers of the Lonely, and its first single, \"Salute Your Solution\", simultaneously in 2008. The album received a Grammy nomination. \n\nThe Dead Weather:\n\nIn early 2009, Jack White formed a new group called The Dead Weather with The Kills frontwoman Alison Mosshart. White takes drum and vocal duties, while The Raconteurs bassist Jack Lawrence and Queens of the Stone Age keyboardist and guitarist Dean Fertita round the four piece out. The group debuted a handful of new tracks on March 11, 2009 in Nashville from their debut album Horehound, which came out July 13, 2009 in Europe and July 14, 2009 in North America, on White's Third Man Records label. On October 16, 2009, Mosshart confirmed that the second album was \"halfway done\". The first single \"Die by the Drop\" was released on March 30, 2010. The new album, Sea of Cowards was released on May 7 in Ireland, then on May 11, 2010, in the U.S. and May 10 in the United Kingdom, and again, on White's Third Man Records. \n\nSolo career:\nIt was rumored that in 2003 White collaborated on Electric Six's song \"Danger! High Voltage.\" Both he and the Electric Six denied this, and the vocal work was credited officially to John S O'Leary. However, a recent radio interview with Tim Shaw on Kerrang! 105.2 in the UK had Electric Six lead singer Dick Valentine talking openly about White singing on this song as well as speculating on the amount of money he was paid ($60,000). Also, a Q magazine article stated that Jack White did in fact work with Electric Six on the song \"Gay Bar\". In 2008, White collaborated with Alicia Keys on the song \"Another Way to Die\", the theme song for the James Bond film Quantum of Solace. He performed five songs for the Cold Mountain soundtrack; \"Sittin' on Top of the World\", \"Wayfaring Stranger\", \"Never Far Away\", \"Christmas Time Soon Will Be Over\" and \"Great High Mountain\". In 2009, Jack White was featured in It Might Get Loud, a film in which he, Jimmy Page, and The Edge come together to discuss the electric guitar and each artist's different playing methods. White's first solo single, \"Fly Farm Blues,\" was written and recorded in 10 minutes during the filming of the movie, in August 2009. The single went on sale as a 7-inch vinyl record from Third Man Records and as a digital single available through iTunes on August 11. In November 2010, producer Danger Mouse announced that White has been recruited for his collaboration with Daniele Luppi entitled Rome along with Norah Jones. White provided vocals to three songs on the album: \"The Rose with the Broken Neck,\" \"Two Against One\" and \"The World.\" The song \"You Know That I Know\", finished and performed by White, was featured on The Lost Notebooks of Hank Williams, released on October 4, 2011. On January 30, 2012 White released \"Love Interruption\" as the first single of his debut solo album, Blunderbuss, which was released on April 24, 2012. On March 3, 2012, he appeared on Saturday Night Live as the musical guest, with Lindsay Lohan hosting. He'll be playing selected dates in the summer, with festivals such as Radio 1's Hackney Weekend, Sasquatch! Music Festival, Fuji Rock Festival in Japan, one of the biggest festivals in the world, Rock Werchter in Belgium, and later in the year, he'll be headlining Austin City Limits Music Festival. For his solo shows, White tours with two bands. One, The Peacocks, is all-female, and the other, The Buzzards (sometimes called Los Buzzardos), is all-male. \n\nMusical equipment and sound:\nThe guitars White uses live are two 1965 JB Hutto Montgomery Airlines (one which he received from a fan), a three pickup Airline Town & Country (used on tour with the Raconteurs and in the \"Steady As She Goes\" music video), a Harmony Rocket, a 1970s-era Crestwood Astral II, 1950s-era Kay Hollowbody (given to him by his brother in return for a favor), a Gretsch White Penguin (as seen in the music video for Icky Thump), and a custom Gretsch Rancher Falcon acoustic guitar. When playing with the Raconteurs, White usually plays two custom Gretsch-styled copies of the Duo Jet double-cutaway guitar, which were made in collaboration with his Seattle luthier, Randy Parsons. His main guitar is dubbed the Triple Jet, which is made of copper and features a Gretsch logo from 1912. For their first tour, Jack also played Gretsch Anniversary Jr. with a Bigsby vibrato tailpiece and three Filtertron pickups. He also uses a Gretsch Rancher acoustic guitar and he now uses a custom Gretsch Anniversary Jr. with two cutaways, a built-in retractable microphone, and a theremin next to the Bigsby. Jack has dubbed this one the \"Triple Green Machine\". Also, he plays occasionally with his Gretsch Rancher, a Gibson J-160E. Also, he plays a Gretsch Duo Jet in Cadillac Green. Recently, he has featured his latest Gretsch, a custom white Billy Gibbons/Bo Diddley signature Gretsch Jupiter Thunderbird in the music video for \"Another Way to Die\", this guitar is also used on his concerts with The Dead Weather, but he also uses a black left-handed one since Sea of Cowards came out. He has also been known to play Fender Telecasters, featuring one in the music video for Loretta Lynn's \"Portland, Oregon\". Jack White has also played in live shows, mainly with The Dead Weather, a Daddy Mojo Stove Pipe Cigar Box Guitar. White uses numerous effects to create his live sound, most notably a DigiTech Whammy WH-4 to create the rapid modulations in pitch he uses in his solos. In concert with an MXR Micro Amp and custom Electro-Harmonix Big Muff Distortion/Sustainer, White can produce a very distinctive sound. In 2005, for the single \"Blue Orchid,\" White employed a new Electro-Harmonix creation, the Polyphonic Octave Generator (POG). Similar to (but more versatile than) the Whammy IV, the POG lets the user mix in several octave effects into one along with the dry signal. He also has three Z.Vex Tremolo Probes, that are hand painted black. All of the pedals that he uses live have been professionally painted red to match his red/black/white color scheme (with the exception of his Whammy and the other pedals that are already red). He plugs this setup into a 1970s Fender Twin Reverb and two 100-Watt Sears Silvertone 6x10 combo amplifiers. He also has a Sonic Machine Factory 15 Watt amp in red that can be seen in Under Great White Northern Lights. He uses this as a travel amp for secret or small shows, and also as the amp for his various keyboards when playing for a larger audience. With the Raconteurs, he has many more unusual pedals. And also, for the Raconteurs' 2008 tour, he had all of his pedals copper plated by Analog Man. White also produces a \"fake\" bass tone by playing the Kay Hollowbody and JB Hutto Montgomery Airline guitars through a Whammy IV set to one octave down for a very thick, low, rumbling sound, which he uses most notably on the songs \"Seven Nation Army\" and \"The Hardest Button to Button\" during live performances. On occasion, White also plays other instruments, such as a Black Gibson F-4 mandolin (\"Little Ghost\"), piano (on most tracks from Get Behind Me Satan, and various others), and an electric piano on such tracks as \"The Air Near My Fingers\" and \"I'm Finding it Harder to be a Gentleman\". White also plays percussion instruments such as the marimba (as on \"The Nurse\"), drums and tambourine. For the White Stripes' 2007 tour, he played a custom-finish Hammond A-100 organ with a Leslie 3300 speaker, which was subsequently loaned to Bob Dylan, and currently resides at Third Man Studios. On Broken Boy Soldiers, he is credited as playing the album's synths and organ; however, bandmate Brendan Benson also received credit for these instruments and it is unclear who played on which song. With the Dead Weather, Jack plays a custom Ludwig Classic Maple kit in Black Oyster Pearl. The sizes consist of the following: 16x26 kick, 5x16 snare (primary) 12x14 marching snare (secondary), 7x16 rack tom 14x16 floor tom, two 16x16 floor toms, Paiste 2002 24\"crash, 24\"ride and two 16\" crashes as hi-hats. For the 2009 Full Flash Blank tour, Jack used a drum head with the Three Brides of Dracula on the front, but in 2010, Jack employs a new drum head, upon the release of Sea of Cowards, which has an image of The Third Man himself: Harry Lime attempting to escape certain capture in the sewers of Vienna. During the American leg of the 2010 tour, Jack switched his drum head again featuring a picture of himself in the guise he wore on the cover of Sea of Cowards. This drum head is called Sam Kay by some fans, referring to the insert inside of the 12\" LP. In 2010, Jack White added an acoustic guitar to his collection named Veronica Lake. It is a custom white Gretsch Rancher with a gold double pickguard and a picture of Veronica Lake on the back. He is currently playing it with his band The Dead Weather. It is the newest addition to \"Jack's Girlfriends\" which already include Claudette Colbert that he plays In the Raconteurs, and Rita Hayworth that he plays in the White Stripes. According to Joe Chiccarelli, engineer for Icky Thump, White is not very technical when it comes to capturing his sound on record: \"Usually he wouldn't talk in terms of compression or EQ or any of those things, it was always about what can we do to give something more aggression or hit you in the face more. Jack's brilliance is his understanding of great emotional performances, and of what it takes to make something come alive through the speakers and have an impact.\" \n\nPersonal life:\n\nWhite gives few interviews and reveals few details of his private life. He states that he does not consider it relevant to his art, saying \"It's the same thing as asking Michelangelo, 'What kind of shoes do you wear?'...In the end, it doesn't really matter ... the only thing that's going to be left is our records and photos.\" A topic of intrigue has been the actual relationship between Jack and Meg White. In early interviews, the pair presented themselves as siblings, two of ten. The Flaming Lips touch on this in their song \"Thank You Jack White (for the Fiber-Optic Jesus That You Gave Me)\" released on their 2003 EP Fight Test. However, the Detroit Free Press produced copies of both a marriage license and divorce certificate, confirming Jack and Meg's history as a married couple. Neither addresses the truth officially and over time, they have become less verbal about the origins of their relationship. Jack White has said, though, that siblings are \"mated for life\", thus such relationships distract less from the music. Jack mentions them being brother and sister in the documentary Under Great White Northern Lights. In the early 1990s, Meg White worked as a bartender at Memphis Smoke, a bar in downtown Royal Oak (a Detroit suburb), where she first met Jack, then still known under his original surname 'Gillis'. They were married on September 21, 1996 and were divorced on March 24, 2000. Jack took her last name. White is often referred to as eccentric. For instance, he has an obsession with the number three. On November 7, 2005, it was widely reported that White had changed his name to \"Three Quid\" (quid is British slang for pound sterling). However, most reports indicated that this would only last until the end of the tour. On December 13, 2003, White was involved in an altercation with Jason Stollsteimer, lead singer of The Von Bondies, at the Magic Stick, a Detroit club. White was charged with misdemeanor aggravated assault. He pleaded guilty to the lesser charge of assault and battery, and was fined $750 (including court costs), and was sentenced to take anger management classes. In 2003, White made his acting debut in Mutant Swinger from Mars, and had a brief but highly publicized romantic relationship with actress Ren√©e Zellweger, whom he met during the filming of Cold Mountain. That summer, the couple were in a car accident in which White broke his left index finger and was forced to reschedule much of the summer tour. He posted the footage of his finger surgery on the web for fans. White and Zellweger's breakup became public in December 2004. White met British model Karen Elson (twin sister of Kate Elson) when she appeared in The White Stripes music video for \"Blue Orchid\". The video's director, Floria Sigismondi, noted \"you sensed an energy between them\". They married on June 1, 2005 in Manaus, Brazil. The wedding took place in a canoe on the Amazon River and was officiated by a shaman. A Roman Catholic priest later convalidated their marriage. Manager Ian Montone was the best man and Meg White was the maid of honor. Official wedding announcements stated that \"it was the first marriage\" for both. On May 2, 2006, the couple had a daughter, Scarlett Teresa White. Their second child, Henry Lee White, was born on August 7, 2007. The White family resides in Brentwood, Tennessee, a suburb south of Nashville, where Elson managed a vintage clothing store called Venus & Mars. The couple announced their divorce in June 2011, throwing a divorce party to celebrate their sixth anniversary and the \"making and breaking of the sacred union of marriage,\" according to the invitation sent to guests. In a press statement, the couple vowed to remain \"dear and trusted friends and co-parents.\" It is rumored that Karen Elson is \"Mildred\" of the Third Man Records produced album, \"Mildred and The Mice\". In 2006, it was revealed in the Sunday Times Rich List that White and his British wife Elson had a joint fortune of at least ¬£20 million (US$37 million). This ranked them at seventh place in the list of entertainers under age 30 who were born or live in the United Kingdom, ahead of the likes of Orlando Bloom and Kate Winslet. \n\nTV appearances:\nOn January 9, 2012, Jack White appeared on American Pickers. In the episode Jack trades his photo booth, first Jukebox, and US$6,000 for a taxidermy elephant head. Jack White appeared as a guest of The Colbert Report in three consecutive episodes in 2011 (June 21-23), and again on April 26, 2012.",

"text": "Sonny John Moore (born January 15, 1988), better known by his stage name Skrillex, is an American electronic music producer and singer-songwriter. Raised in Northeast Los Angeles and in Northern California, Moore joined the American post-hardcore band From First to Last as the lead singer in 2004, and recorded two studio albums with the band (Dear Diary, My Teen Angst Has a Body Count, 2004, and Heroine, 2006) before leaving to pursue a solo career in 2007. He began his first tour as a solo artist in late 2007. After recruiting a new band lineup, Moore joined the Alternative Press Tour to support bands such as All Time Low and The Rocket Summer, and appeared on the cover of Alternative Press' annual \"100 Bands You Need to Know\" issue. After releasing the Gypsyhook EP in 2009, Moore was scheduled to record his debut studio album, Bells, with producer Noah Shain. However, he ceased production of the album and began performing under the name Skrillex. After releasing the My Name is Skrillex EP for free download on his official MySpace page, he released the Scary Monsters and Nice Sprites EP in late-2010 and More Monsters and Sprites EP in mid-2011. Both have since become moderate commercial successes. On November 30, 2011, he was nominated for a total of five Grammy Awards at the 54th Grammy Awards, including Best New Artist and won three: \"Best Dance/Electronica Album,\" \"Best Dance Recording,\" and \"Best Remixed Recording, Non-Classical\". On December 5, 2011, the BBC announced that he had been nominated for their Sound of 2012 poll. On December 12, 2011, he was also named MTV's Electronic Dance Music Artist of the Year. \n\nBiography:\n\nBackground:\nMoore was born in the Highland Park neighborhood of Northeast Los Angeles, but moved to the Forest Hill neighborhood of San Francisco at the age of two, where he attended elementary school. At the ages of nine and ten, Moore attended a local boarding school located in the Mojave Desert LV, but eventually moved back to Northern California. By the age of twelve, his family moved him back to his birthplace of Northeast L.A., where he enrolled in a private academy school specializing in arts, and was then later home schooled at the age of fourteen due to bullying. In 2004, he learned he was adopted and dropped out of the program when he was sixteen years old. While a young teenager in Los Angeles, Moore would attend punk gigs in Mexican American neighborhoods in East and South Los Angeles, and later on electro club raves in the downtown's Silver Lake and Echo Park neighborhoods. \n\nFrom First to Last (2004-07):\nIn 2004, Moore contacted Matt Good of From First to Last about playing guitar for the band on their debut album. After flying out to Georgia, Moore was heard singing by three studio producers, Derrick Thomas, Eric Dale, and McHale Butler, and was then made lead singer, with Good playing guitar. In June 2004, Epitaph Records released the band's first full-length record with their new bandmate, Dear Diary, My Teen Angst Has a Body Count. After performing on several successful tours, two being the Vans Warped Tour and Dead by Dawn tour, they began recording their second album, Heroine with producer Ross Robinson. The album was released in March 2006 on Epitaph. With high record sales once again, the band found themselves part of many successful tours, until Moore started suffering vocal problems, causing the band to resign from several tours. After going through a successful vocal surgical procedure, Moore informed the band he would be permanently resigning to work on a solo career. FFTL's last show performed with Moore was in their hometown of Orlando at The House of Blues while touring with Atreyu. \n\nSolo career (2007-present):\n\nMoore announced he had left From First to Last to pursue a solo career. He then launched a Myspace page displaying three demos (\"Signal\", \"Equinox\", and \"Glow Worm\"). This led to Moore's first performance since his leaving From First to Last. On April 7, 2007, alongside harpist Carol Robbins, Moore played several original songs at a local art building. After months of releasing demos via Myspace, Moore played on the Team Sleep Tour with a full band. The tour also featured supporting acts Monster in the Machine and Strata. Moore made several demo CDs available on this tour, limited to about 30 per show. These CDs were tour exclusive, and were packaged in \"baby blue envelopes\", each with a unique drawing by Moore or bandmate. In February 2008, Alternative Press Magazine announced the second annual AP Tour, with All Time Low, The Rocket Summer, The Matches, and Forever the Sickest Kids, as well as Sonny Moore. The tour started in Houston, Texas on March 14 and went through North America, ending in Cleveland, Ohio on May 2, with the majority of the shows being sold out. All bands playing the tour would be featured on the cover of Alternative Press Magazine's annual 100 Bands You Need to Know special, and would be interviewed on the Alternative Press Podcast. During this tour Moore's line-up consisted of Sean Friday on drums, Christopher Null on guitar, and Aaron Rothe on keyboards. On April 7, 2009, he released Gypsyhook EP, a digital EP, which featured three songs and four remixes. Also included was a Japanese version of \"Mora\" entitled \"Êµ∑Ê∞¥\" (\"Kaisui\"). Physical copies of the EP were available at his shows. After going on tour with Innerpartysystem and Paper Route and opening for Chiodos on their European tour, Moore performed at Bamboozle on May 2. He performed on Bamboozle Left's Saints and Sinners stage on April 4. He toured with Hollywood Undead in April 2009 performing under the band name Sonny and the Blood Monkeys, with Chris Null (electric guitar), Sean Friday (drums, percussion & beats) and Aaron Rothe (keyboards, synthesizers, programming & turntables) Although no official statement has been given regarding the album, Moore has stated that Bells will no longer be released. \n\nProduction career:\n\nIn 2008, Moore began producing and performing under the alias Skrillex at clubs in the Los Angeles area. Previously, he had been known on the Internet as Twipz. On June 7, 2010, Moore released his official Skrillex debut EP, My Name is Skrillex as a free download. Moore provided programming and vocals for UK metalcore band Bring Me the Horizon on their third studio album, There Is a Hell, Believe Me I've Seen It. There Is a Heaven, Let's Keep It a Secret. Later in the year, Sonny began a nationwide tour with Deadmau5 after being signed to mau5trap recordings and released his second EP, Scary Monsters and Nice Sprites. Moore kicked off the \"Project Blue Book Tour\" in 2011 with support from Porter Robinson, Tommy Lee and DJ Aero as well as appearances from Sofia Toufa for a new song titled \"Bring out the Devil.\" Skrillex unveiled several new songs on this tour including \"First Of The Year\" (formerly known as \"Equinox\"), \"Reptile\", and \"Cinema\" (remix of a Benny Benassi track). \"Reptile\" was featured in the TV commercial for Mortal Kombat 9, and \"First of the Year (Equinox)\" is featured on his follow up EP and remix companion to Scary Monsters and Nice Sprites, titled More Monsters and Sprites. In April 2011, Spin magazine premiered \"Get Up\", an exclusive new track from Korn that was produced by Skrillex. Korn made \"Get Up\" available for free download via their Facebook page. On April 15, 2011 KoRn joined Skrillex on stage for his set at Coachella 2011. On April 18, 2011, Sony Computer Entertainment (SCEA) development studio Naughty Dog released a trailer for the multiplayer component of their PlayStation 3 game Uncharted 3: Drake's Deception, featuring \"Kill EVERYBODY\" from Scary Monsters and Nice Sprites. In June 2011, \"More Monsters and Sprites\" was released on Beatport, an EP consisting of three original tracks, including \"First of the Year (Equinox)\" and two versions of his original track \"Ruffneck\". A leaked track entitled \"Ruffneck Bass\" had been leaked on the internet months prior which used the same sample as in the new \"Ruffneck\" tracks on the EP. Skrillex released a music video for \"Rock n' Roll (Will Take You to the Mountain)\" on his official YouTube page on June 20, 2011. \n\nOn August 17, 2011 Skrillex announced his label, OWSLA. \"The label's first releases will come from Bristol-based dubstep producer Koan Sound, electro-house newcomer Porter Robinson from North Carolina, singer/songwriter Alvin Risk, and San Francisco-based M Machine (formally Metropolis).\" Skrillex released a music video for \"First of the Year (Equinox)\" via Spin.com on August 19, 2011. In late August 2011 it was released that he would be appearing Knife Party's first release, collaborating on a Moombahton style track entitled \"Zoology\". A preview was released on YouTube. In late September 2011 he created the track \"Syndicate\" as promotion for the video game of the same name. Kaskade's 2011 album Fire & Ice features a collaboration between Kaskade and Skrillex entitled \"Lick It\". The video for Skrillex's song \"First of the Year (Equinox)\" appears on the first episode of the Beavis and Butt-head revival. On November 8, Skrillex stated that he intended to release an album entitled Voltage. Skrillex gave fans more info about Voltage in RockSound Magazine after a photoshoot for the cover and doing an extensive interview on his tour. For unknown reasons, however, the album was never released. On December 21, 2011, Skrillex unveiled the Bangarang EP for a Beatport release on December 23. On March 13, 2012, Beatport released OWSLA's second Free Treats sampler, Free Treats Vol. 2. The 19-track compilation features \"Ruffneck (FULL Flex) Munchi Anonymous Revolution Remix\", a remixed track by Skrillex. This new take on the track deviates from the original (released on the More Monsters and Sprites EP), with the remix being more characteristic of Electro House, though with a much slower tempo of 108 BPM, versus the original version's classic Dubstep tempo of 140 BPM, also straying from the typical Electro House tempo of 128 BPM. On August 12, 2012, his new side-project formed with Boys Noize called Dog Blood released an EP called Next Order/Middle Finger. \n\nInfluences:\nMoore has stated in an online interview that he has been a longtime fan of Warp, an electronic music label that has released recordings from artists such as Aphex Twin and Squarepusher. \n\nPersonal life:\nAs of February 2012, Skrillex has been dating fellow artist and singer, Ellie Goulding, who provided vocals for the Skrillex track, \"Summit\", featured on the EP, Bangarang.",

"text": "Green Day is an American punk rock band formed in 1987. The band consists of lead vocalist and guitarist Billie Joe Armstrong, bassist and backing vocalist Mike Dirnt, and drummer Tre Cool. Cool replaced former drummer John Kiffmeyer in 1990, prior to the recording of the band's second studio album, Kerplunk (1992). Green Day was originally part of the punk scene at 924 Gilman Street in Berkeley, California. The band's early releases were from the independent record label Lookout! Records. In 1994, its major label debut Dookie released through Reprise Records became a breakout success and eventually sold over 10 million copies in the U.S. Green Day was widely credited, alongside fellow California punk bands Sublime,The Offspring and Rancid, with popularizing and reviving mainstream interest in punk rock in the United States. Green Day's three follow-up albums, Insomniac (1995), Nimrod (1997), and Warning (2000) did not achieve the massive success of Dookie, though they were still successful, with Insomniac and Nimrod reaching double platinum and Warning reaching gold status. The band's rock opera, American Idiot (2004), reignited the band's popularity with a younger generation, selling five million copies in the United States. The band's eighth studio album, 21st Century Breakdown, was released in 2009 which achieved the band's best chart performance to date. The band will begin to release a trilogy of albums called ¬°Uno!, ¬°Dos!, and ¬°Tr√©!, to be released September 25, 2012, November 13, 2012, and January 15, 2013 respectively. Green Day has sold over 65 million records worldwide with 25 million in the US alone. The group has won five Grammy Awards: Best Alternative Album for Dookie, Best Rock Album for American Idiot, Record of the Year for \"Boulevard of Broken Dreams\", Best Rock Album for the second time for 21st Century Breakdown and Best Musical Show Album for American Idiot: The Original Broadway Cast Recording. In 2010, a stage adaptation of American Idiot debuted on Broadway. The musical was nominated for several Tony Awards, including Best Musical and Best Scenic Design. \n\nHistory:\n\nFormation and Lookout! years (1987-1993):\nIn 1987, friends Billie Joe Armstrong and Mike Dirnt, 15 years old at the time, formed a band called Sweet Children. Its first live performance took place on October 17, 1987 at Rod's Hickory Pit in Vallejo, California. In 1988, Armstrong and Dirnt began working with Sean Hughes and the former Isocracy drummer John Kiffmeyer, also known as \"Al Sobrante\". As said in the film Punk's Not Dead, Armstrong cites the band Operation Ivy (which featured Tim Armstrong and Matt Freeman of Rancid) as a major influence, and a group that inspired him to form a band. In 1988, Larry Livermore, owner of Lookout! Records, saw the band play an early show and signed the group to his label. In 1989, the band recorded its debut extended play, 1,000 Hours. Before 1,000 Hours was released, the group dropped the name Sweet Children; according to Livermore, this was done to avoid confusion with another local band Sweet Baby. The band adopted the name Green Day, due to their fondness for marijuana. Lookout! would release Green Day's debut studio album, 39/Smooth in early 1990. Green Day would record two extended plays later that year, Slappy and Sweet Children, the latter of which included older songs that the band had recorded for the Minneapolis independent record label Skene! Records. In 1991, Lookout! Records re-released 39/Smooth under the name 1,039/Smoothed Out Slappy Hours, and added the songs from the band's first two EPs, Slappy, and 1,000 Hours. In late 1990, shortly after the band's first nationwide tour, Sobrante left the East Bay area to attend college.The Lookouts drummer Tre Cool began filling in as a temporary replacement and later Cool's position as Green Day's drummer became permanent. The band went on tour for most of 1992 and 1993, and played a number of shows overseas in Europe. The band's second studio album Kerplunk sold 50,000 copies in the U.S. \n\nBreakthrough success (1994-1996):\n\nKerplunk's underground success led to a number of major record labels being interested in signing Green Day, and the band eventually left Lookout! and signed to Reprise Records after attracting the attention of producer Rob Cavallo. The group was impressed by his work with fellow Californian band The Muffs, and later remarked that Cavallo \"was the only person we could really talk to and connect with\". Reflecting on the period, Armstrong told Spin magazine in 1999, \"I couldn't go back to the punk scene, whether we were the biggest success in the world or the biggest failure ... The only thing I could do was get on my bike and go forward.\" After signing with Reprise, the band went to work on recording its major label debut, Dookie. Recorded in three weeks, and released in February 1994,Dookie became a commercial success, helped by extensive MTV airplay for the videos of the songs \"Longview\", \"Basket Case\", and \"When I Come Around\", all of which reached the number one position on the Modern Rock Tracks charts. That year, Green Day embarked on a nationwide tour with queercore band Pansy Division as its opening act. At a September 9, 1994 performance at Hatch Memorial Shell in Boston, mayhem broke-out during the band's set (cut short to seven songs) and by the end of the rampage, 100 people were injured and 45 arrested. The band also joined the lineups of both the Lollapalooza festival and Woodstock '94, where they started an infamous mud fight. During the concert, a security guard mistook bassist Mike Dirnt for a stage-invading fan and punched out some of his teeth. Viewed by millions by pay-per-view television, the Woodstock 1994 performance further aided Green Day's growing publicity and recognition, and helped push its album to eventual diamond status. In 1995, Dookie won the Grammy Award for Best Alternative Album and the band was nominated for nine MTV Video Music Awards including Video of the Year. In 1995, a new single for the Angus soundtrack was released, entitled \"J.A.R.\". The single debuted at number one on the Billboard Modern Rock Tracks chart. The song was followed by the band's fourth studio album, Insomniac, which was released in the fall of 1995. Insomniac was a much darker and heavier response to the band's newfound popularity, compared to the more melodic Dookie. The album opened to a warm critical reception, earning 4 out of 5 stars from Rolling Stone, which said \"In punk, the good stuff actually unfolds and gains meaning as you listen without sacrificing any of its electric, haywire immediacy. And Green Day are as good as this stuff gets.\" The singles released from Insomniac were \"Geek Stink Breath\", \"Stuck with Me\", \"Brain Stew/Jaded\", and \"Walking Contradiction\". Though the album did not approach the success of Dookie, it sold two million copies in the United States. In addition, the album won the band award nominations for Favorite Artist, Favorite Hard Rock Artist, and Favorite Alternative Artist at the 1996 American Music Awards, and the video for \"Walking Contradiction\" got the band a Grammy nomination for Best Video, Short Form, in addition to a Best Special Effects nomination at the MTV Video Music Awards. After that, the band abruptly cancelled a European tour, citing exhaustion. \n\nMiddle years and decline in commercial success (1997-2002):\nAfter a brief hiatus in 1996, Green Day began to work on a new album in 1997. From the outset, both the band and Cavallo agreed that the album had to be different from its previous albums. The result was Nimrod, an experimental deviation from the band's standard pop-punk brand of music. The new album was released in October 1997. It provided a variety of music, from pop-punk, surf rock, and ska, to an acoustic ballad. Nimrod entered the charts at number 10. The success of \"Good Riddance (Time of Your Life)\" won the band an MTV Video Award for Best Alternative Video. The song was also used in the second \"clip show\" episode of Seinfeld and on two episodes of ER. The other singles released from Nimrod were \"Nice Guys Finish Last\", \"Hitchin' a Ride\" and \"Redundant\". The band made a guest appearance in an episode of King of the Hill entitled \"The Man Who Shot Cane Skretteberg\", which aired in 1997. In late 1997 and most of 1998, Green Day embarked on a tour in support of Nimrod. In 2000, Green Day released its sixth studio album Warning. In support of the album, the band participated in the Warped Tour in 2000. The band also had an independent tour to support the album in 2001. Critics' reviews of the album were varied.Allmusic gave it 4.5/5 saying \"Warning may not be an innovative record per se, but it's tremendously satisfying.\"Rolling Stone was more critical, giving it 3/5, and saying \"Warning... invites the question: Who wants to listen to songs of faith, hope and social commentary from what used to be snot-core's biggest-selling band?\" Though it produced the hit \"Minority\" and a smaller hit with \"Warning\", some observers were coming to the conclusion that the band was losing relevance, and a decline in popularity followed. While all of Green Day's previous albums had reached a status of at least double platinum, Warning was only certified gold. At the 2001 California Music Awards, Green Day won all eight of the awards that it was nominated for. The group won the awards for Outstanding Album (Warning), Outstanding Punk Rock/Ska Album (Warning), Outstanding Group, Outstanding Male Vocalist, Outstanding Bassist, Outstanding Drummer, Outstanding Songwriter, and Outstanding Artist. The release of two compilation albums, International Superhits! and Shenanigans, followed Warning. International Superhits and its companion collection of music videos, International Supervideos!. Shenanigans contained some of the band's b-sides, including \"Espionage\", which was featured in the film Austin Powers: The Spy Who Shagged Me and was nominated for a Grammy Award for Best Rock Instrumental Performance. In the spring of 2002, Green Day co-headlined the Pop Disaster Tour with Blink-182 which was documented on the DVD Riding in Vans with Boys. \n\nAmerican Idiot and renewed success (2003-2006):\n\nIn the summer of 2003, the band went into a studio to write and record new material for a new album, tentatively titled Cigarettes and Valentines. After completing 20 tracks, the master recordings were stolen from the studio. Instead of re-recording the stolen tracks, the band decided to abandon the entire project and start over, considering the material to be unrepresentative of the band's best work. It was then revealed that a band called The Network was signed to Armstrong's record label Adeline Records with little fanfare and information. After the mysterious band released an album called Money Money 2020, it was rumored that The Network was a Green Day side project, due to the similarities in the bands' sounds. However, these rumors were never addressed by the band or Adeline Records, except for a statement on the Adeline website discussing an ongoing dispute between the two bands. Green Day collaborated with Iggy Pop on two tracks for his album Skull Ring in November 2003. On February 1, 2004 a new song, a cover of \"I Fought the Law\" made its debut on a commercial for iTunes during NFL Super Bowl XXXVIII. \n\nThe resulting album, American Idiot (2004), debuted at number one on the Billboard charts, the band's first album to reach number one, backed by the success of the album's first single, American Idiot. The album was labeled as a punk rock opera which follows the journey of the fictitious Jesus of Suburbia.American Idiot won the 2005 Grammy for Best Rock Album. The band also won a total of seven awards out of eight awards for which they were nominated, including the Viewer's Choice Award in MTV Video Music Awards 2005. Through 2005, the band toured in support of the album with nearly 150 dates (Longest tour in their career) visiting Japan, Australia, South America and the United Kingdom. While touring for American Idiot, they filmed and recorded the two concerts at the Milton Keynes National Bowl in England, which was voted 'The Best Show On Earth' in a Kerrang! Magazine Poll. These recordings were released as a live CD and DVD called Bullet in a Bible on November 15, 2005. This CD/DVD featured songs from American Idiot as well as songs from all its previous albums, except Kerplunk and 1,039/Smoothed Out Slappy Hours. The DVD featured behind-the-scenes footage of the band, and showed how the band prepared to put on the show. The final shows of its 2005 world tour were in Sydney and Melbourne in Australia, on December 14 and 17 respectively. On August 1, 2005, Green Day announced that it had rescinded the master rights to its pre-Dookie material from Lookout! Records, citing a continuing breach of contract regarding unpaid royalties, a complaint shared with other Lookout! bands. On January 10, 2006 the band was awarded with a People's Choice Award as favorite musical group or band. \n\n21st Century Breakdown and American Idiot: The Musical (2006-2010):\nGreen Day engaged in a number of other smaller projects in the time following the success of American Idiot. The group released an album under the name Foxboro Hot Tubs entitled Stop Drop and Roll!!!. In 2008, the Foxboro Hot Tubs went on a mini-tour to promote the record, hitting tiny Bay Area venues including the Stork Club in Oakland and Toot's Tavern in Crockett, CA. \n\nIn an interview with Carson Daly, Garbage lead singer Shirley Manson revealed that Butch Vig would be producing Green Day's forthcoming album. The span of nearly five years between American Idiot and 21st Century Breakdown was the longest gap between studio albums in Green Day's career. The band had been working on new material since January 2006. By October 2007, Armstrong had 45 songs written, but the band showed no further signs of progress until October 2008, when two videos showing the band recording in the studio with producer Butch Vig were posted on YouTube. The writing and recording process, spanning three years and four recording studios, was finally finished in April 2009. 21st Century Breakdown, was released on May 15, 2009. The album received a mainly positive reception from critics, getting an average rating between 3 and 4 stars. After the release, the album reached number one in fourteen countries, being certified gold or platinum in each. 21st Century Breakdown achieved Green Day's best chart performance to date. The band started playing shows in California in April and early May. It was their first live show in about three years. Green Day went on a world tour that started in North America in July 2009 and continuing around the world throughout the rest of 2009 and early 2010.Wal-Mart refused to carry the album as it contains a Parental Advisory sticker and requested that Green Day release a censored edition. The band members did not wish to change any lyrics on the album and responded by stating, \"There's nothing dirty about our record... They want artists to censor their records in order to be carried in there. We just said no. We've never done it before. You feel like you're in 1953 or something.\" In 2009, the band met with award-winning director Michael Mayer and many cast and crew members of the Tony Award-winning musical Spring Awakening to create a stage version of the album American Idiot.American Idiot: The Musical opened in the Berkeley Repertory Theatre during the end of 2009. The show features an expanded story of the original album, with new characters such as Will, Extraordinary Girl, and Favorite Son. On April 20, 2010, American Idiot: The Musical opened on Broadway, and Green Day released the soundtrack to the musical, featuring a new song by Green Day entitled \"When It's Time\". In June 2010 the iTunes received the single \"When It's Time\". During the Spike TV Video Game Awards 2009, it was announced that Green Day was set to have its own Rock Band video game titled as Green Day: Rock Band, as a follow-up to the last band specific Rock Band game, The Beatles: Rock Band. The game features the full albums of Dookie, American Idiot, and 21st Century Breakdown as well as select songs from the rest of Green Day's discography. During the second leg of the 21st Century Breakdown World Tour the band had said that they are writing new material. In an interview with Kerrang! magazine, Armstrong spoke about the possible new album: \"We did some demos in Berlin, some in Stockholm, some just outside of Glasgow and some in Amsterdam. We wanted get the songs down in some early form.\" The band also stated that they were recording a live album during the entire tour on the last date of the tour in Mountain View, California, also before playing the song \"Cigarettes and Valentines\". In October 2010, Dirnt was interviewed by Radio W, mentioning that they have completed the writing process of the ninth studio album. In the interview, Dirnt also mentioned that a new live album will \"most likely\" be released. The live CD/DVD and CD/Blu-ray entitled Awesome as Fuck was released on March 22, 2011. \n\n¬°Uno!, ¬°Dos!, and ¬°Tr√©! (2011-present):\nOn August 11, 2011, Green Day played a secret show in Costa Mesa, California, and performed an entire set of over 15 new songs allegedly for a possible upcoming album. Green Day put a news post on their official website which read \"Thanks everyone for coming out to the show...\" and \"Stay tuned for more\". It also included lyrics to a new song that was played at the show called \"Amy\" which is dedicated to Amy Winehouse, who died weeks before the show. In February 2012, Armstrong announced through Twitter that the band were in the studio, recording material for a new album. On February 24, 2012, the band began uploading behind the scenes videos of the recording of the new album to YouTube. On April 11, singer Billie Joe Armstrong announced that Green Day would be releasing a trilogy of albums called ¬°Uno!, ¬°Dos!, and ¬°Tr√©!. Armstrong stated that they would be released on September 25, 2012, November 13, 2012, and January 15, 2013 respectively. On June 14, 2012, Green Day released the official artwork of the album ¬°Uno! on YouTube and Facebook. Armstrong in a talk with Rolling Stone Magazine confirmed that each album will have a member of the band on its cover. The ¬°Uno! ¬°Dos! ¬°Tr√©! Ultimate Box Set has also been announced by Warner Bros. Records and will contain all three albums, as well as various other content, such as three digital singles and a one year online membership or renewal to the Idiot Club. The band played at the Rock En Seine festival in France on August 24-26, 2012, the Rock am See festival in Germany on September 1, 2012 and the Reading festival in the UK. The band has also announced a US tour supporting the trilogy, from November 2012 through February 2013. ¬°Uno! was released on September 24, 2012 and has been met with generally favorable reviews. \n\nMusical style and influences:\n\nGreen Day's sound is often compared to first wave punk bands such as the Ramones, The Clash, Sex Pistols, and the Buzzcocks. Citing the band's musical style prevalent on Dookie, Stephen Erlewine of Allmusic described Green Day as \"punk revivalists who recharged the energy of speedy, catchy three-chord punk-pop songs.\" While Armstrong is the primary songwriter, he looks to the other band members for organizational help. Billie Joe Armstrong has mentioned that some of his biggest influences are seminal alternative rock bands H√ºsker D√º and The Replacements, and that their influence is particularly noted in the band's chord changes in songs. Green Day has covered H√ºsker D√º's \"Don't Want to Know If You Are Lonely\" as a b-side to the \"Warning\" single, and the character \"Mr. Whirly\" in their song \"Misery\" is a reference to the Replacements song of the same name. Among other influences, Green Day have also cited The Who and power pop pioneers Cheap Trick. The band has generated controversy over whether the band's musical style and major-label status constitutes as \"true punk\". In reaction to both the style of music and the background of the band, John Lydon, former front man of the 1970s punk band the Sex Pistols commented: \n\"So there we are fending off all that and it pisses me off that years later a wank outfit like Green Day hop in and nick all that and attach it to themselves. They didn't earn their wings to do that and if they were true punk they wouldn't look anything like they do.\" \nArmstrong himself has discussed the group's status of being a punk band on a major record label, saying \"Sometimes I think we've become totally redundant because we're this big band now, we've made a lot of money - we're not punk rock any more. But then I think about it and just say, 'You can take us out of a punk rock environment, but you can't take the punk rock out of us.'\" English rock musician Noel Gallagher of Oasis also complained about the band semi-jokingly, claiming that they ripped off his song \"Wonderwall\" with their song \"Boulevard of Broken Dreams\". \n\nRelated projects:\nSince 1991, members of the band have branched out past Green Day and have started other projects with other musicians. Notable related projects of Green Day include Billie Joe Armstrong's Pinhead Gunpowder (which also features Green Day's live back-up guitarist Jason White), The Frustrators in which Mike Dirnt plays bass, and The Network, a collaboration between Green Day and members of the band, Devo in which all members play under fake stage names. Green Day has also released an album titled Stop Drop and Roll!!! on May 20, 2008, under the name Foxboro Hot Tubs, they currently use this name to book secret shows. In late December 2011, Armstrong formed a new side band called The Boo along his wife Adrienne and their two sons. In September 2006, Green Day collaborated with U2 and producer Rick Rubin to record a cover of the song \"The Saints Are Coming\", originally recorded by The Skids, with an accompanying video. The song was recorded to benefit Music Rising, an organization to help raise money for musicians' instruments lost during Hurricane Katrina, and to bring awareness on the eve of the one year anniversary of the disaster. In December 2006, Green Day and NRDC opened a web site in partnership to raise awareness on America's dependency on oil. Green Day released a cover of the John Lennon song \"Working Class Hero\", which was featured on the album Instant Karma: The Amnesty International Campaign to Save Darfur. The band performed the song on the season finale of American Idol. The song was nominated for a Grammy Award in 2008, though lost to The White Stripes' \"Icky Thump\". That summer, the band appeared in a cameo role in The Simpsons Movie, where they perform the show's theme song. Their version was released as a single on July 24, 2007. In 2009, the band collaborated with theatre director Michael Mayer to adapt their rock opera American Idiot into a one-act stage musical that premiered at the Berkeley Rep on September 15, 2009. The show then moved to Broadway on April 20, 2010. The reviews of American Idiot: The Musical have been positive to mixed. Charles Isherwood of The New York Times wrote an enthusiastic review for the Broadway production. He called the show \"a pulsating portrait of wasted youth that invokes all the standard genre conventions ... only to transcend them through the power of its music and the artistry of its execution, the show is as invigorating and ultimately as moving as anything I've seen on Broadway this season. Or maybe for a few seasons past.\" Jed Gottlieb of the Boston Herald enjoyed the premise of the show but found that \"the music and message suffer in a setting where the audience is politely, soberly seated\". Michael Kuchiwara of the Associated Press found the show to be \"visually striking and musically adventurous\", but noted that \"the show has the barest wisp of a story and minimal character development\". Paul Kolnik in USA Today enjoyed the contradiction that Green Day's \"massively popular, starkly disenchanted album ... would be the feel-good musical of the season\". Time magazine's Richard Zoglin opined that the score \"is as pure a specimen of contemporary punk rock as Broadway has yet encountered yet there's enough variety. ... Where the show fall short is as a fully developed narrative.\" He concluded that \"American Idiot, despite its earnest huffing and puffing, remains little more than an annotated rock concert. ... Still, it deserves at least two cheers - for its irresistible musical energy and for opening fresh vistas for that odd couple, rock and Broadway.\" Peter Travers from Rolling Stone, in his review of American Idiot, wrote \"Though American Idiot carries echoes of such rock musicals as Tommy, Hair, Rent and Spring Awakening, it cuts its own path to the heart. You won't know what hit you. American Idiot knows no limits--it's a global knockout.\" The musical has been nominated for a number of Tony Awards, including Best Musical and Best Scenic Design. It was also nominated for a number of Drama Desk Awards and Outer Critics Circle Awards. In October 2009, a Green Day art project was exhibited at StolenSpace Gallery in London. The exhibition showed artworks created for each of the songs on 21st Century Breakdown, was supported by the band, and led by their manager Pat Magnarella. He explained in an interview that \"Artists are basically like rock bands. Most are creating their art, but don't know how to promote it.\" For Billie Joe Armstrong, \"Many of the artists... show their work on the street, and we feel a strong connection to that type of creative expression.\" On April 13, 2011, a film version of American Idiot was confirmed. Michael Mayer, director of the Broadway musical, will be directing the film. It will be produced by Green Day, Pat Magnarella (Green Day's manager who also produced Bullet in a Bible, Awesome as Fuck, and Heart Like a Hand Grenade), Playtone (Tom Hanks and Gary Goetzman) and Tom Hulce. \n\nInvolvement in politics and social justice:\nWhen asked his opinion regarding whether all musicians ought to try to add a social or political message to their work, Armstrong replied that \" \nThe only people who should sing about social issues or politics are the ones who aren't full of shit. \n\" \n American Idiot was released two months before former President of the United States George W. Bush was reelected, and as a result the album became protest art. Created as an anti-war album, American Idiot contains many new-age protest songs, like Holiday which was against George Bush's decision to invade Iraq. Armstrong described the song as a means by which \"to battle your way out of your own ignorance\". \n\nBand members:\n\nCurrent members \nBillie Joe Armstrong - lead vocals, guitar, piano, harmonica (1987-present), \nMike Dirnt - bass, backing vocals (1988-present), rhythm guitar (1987-1988), \nTr√© Cool - drums, percussion, backing vocals (1990-present), \nSession and touring members \nJason White - lead and rhythm guitars, backing vocals (1999-present), \nJason Freese - keyboards, piano, saxophone, trombone, backing vocals (2003-present), \nJeff Matika - rhythm guitar, acoustic guitar, backing vocals (2009-present), \n\nFormer members \nJohn Kiffmeyer - drums, percussion (1987-1990), \nSean Hughes - bass (1987-1988), \nFormer touring members \nTimmy Chunks - guitars (1997-1999), \nGarth Schultz - trombone, trumpet (1997-1999), \nGabrial McNair - trombone, tenor saxophone (1999-2001), \nJeanne Geiger - trombone (2001), \nKurt Lohmiller - trumpet, timpani, percussion, backing vocals (1999-2004), \nMike Pelino - rhythm guitar, backing vocals (2004-2005), \nRonnie Blake - trumpet, timpani, percussion, backing vocals (2004-2005)",

"text": "Green Day is an American rock trio formed in 1987. The band has consisted of Billie Joe Armstrong (vocals, guitar), Mike Dirnt (bass guitar, vocals), and Tr√© Cool (drums, percussion) for the majority of its existence.  Green Day was originally part of the punk rock scene at 924 Gilman Street, Berkeley in  East Bay, CA, United States . Its early releases for independent record label Lookout! Records earned them a grassroots fanbase, some of whom felt alienated when the band signed to a major label. Nevertheless, its major label debut Dookie (1994) became a breakout success and eventually sold over 10 million copies in the US. and 15 million worldwide. As a result, Green Day was widely credited, alongside fellow California punk bands The Offspring and Rancid, with reviving mainstream interest in and popularizing punk rock in the United States. Green Day's three follow-up albums, Insomniac, Nimrod and Warning did not achieve the massive success of Dookie, but they were still successful, reaching double platinum, double platinum, and gold status respectively. Green Day's 2004 rock opera American Idiot reignited the band's popularity with a younger generation, selling five million copies in the U.S.The band's eighth studio album, 21st Century Breakdown, was released on May 15, 2009.  Green Day has sold over 22 million records in the United States.They have won three Grammy Awards; Best Alternative Album for Dookie, Best Rock Album for American Idiot, and Record of the Year for Boulevard of Broken Dreams.  In 1987, friends Billie Joe Armstrong and Mike Dirnt, 15 years old at the time, formed a band called Sweet Children. The first Sweet Children show took place on October 17, 1987, at Rod's Hickory Pit in Vallejo, California where Armstrong's mother was working.In 1988, Armstrong and Dirnt began working with former Isocracy drummer, John Kiffmeyer (also known as Al Sobrante). Kiffmeyer served as both the band's drummer and business manager, handling the booking of shows and helping the band establish a fan base.  Larry Livermore, owner of Lookout! Records, saw the band play an early show and signed them to his label. In 1989 they recorded their first EP, 1,000 Hours. Before 1,000 Hours was released, the band dropped the name Sweet Children, according to Livermore this was done in order to avoid confusion with another local band Sweet Baby.The band adopted the name Green Day, allegedly due to their fondness of marijuana.  Lookout! would release Green Day's first LP, 39/Smooth in early 1990. Green Day would record two EPs later that year: Slappy and Sweet Children, the latter of which included some older songs they had recorded for Minneapolis indie label Skene! Records. In 1991, Lookout! Records released 1,039/Smoothed Out Slappy Hours, a compilation of the 39/Smooth, Slappy, and 1,000 Hours EPs. In late 1990, shortly after the band's first nationwide tour, Sobrante left the East Bay area to attend college. The Lookouts drummer Tr√© Cool began filling in as a temporary replacement, and when it became clear that Sobrante did not plan on committing to the band full time, Tr√© Cool's position as Green Day's drummer became permanent. The band went on tour for most of 1992 and 1993, and played a stretch of shows overseas in Europe. The band's second full length album Kerplunk sold about 50,000 copies in the U.S., which was considered quite a large amount for the independent punk scene in 1992.  Kerplunk's underground success led to a wave of interest coming from major record labels, and eventually they left Lookout! on friendly terms and signed with Reprise Records after attracting the attention of producer Rob Cavallo. Signing to Reprise caused many punk rock fans to regard Green Day as sellouts.Reflecting on the period, Armstrong told SPIN magazine in 1999, \"I couldn't go back to the punk scene, whether we were the biggest success in the world or the biggest failure ... The only thing I could do was get on my bike and go forward.\" After signing with Reprise, the band went to work on recording its major label debut, Dookie.  \"Longview\" Play sound Sample of \"Longview\", the first single from Dookie, which combined a memorable bass line with a guitar riff and drums introduced in the chorus. Problems listening to this file? See media help.  \"Basket Case\" Play sound Sample of \"Basket Case\", the third single from Dookie, which was about Armstrong's panic attacks. Problems listening to this file? See media help.  Released in February 1994, and recorded in 3 weeks,Dookie became a commercial success, helped by extensive MTV airplay for the videos of the songs \"Longview\", \"Basket Case\", and \"When I Come Around\", all of which reached the number one position on the Modern Rock Tracks charts. That year, Green Day embarked on a nationwide tour with queercore band Pansy Division as its opening act. At a September 9, 1994 concert at Boston Esplanade, mayhem broke-out during the band's set (cut short to seven songs) and by the end of the rampage, 100 people were injured and 45 arrested. The band also joined the lineups of both the Lollapalooza festival and Woodstock 1994, where they started an infamous mud fight. During the concert, a security guard mistook bassist Mike Dirnt for a stage-invading fan and punched out some of his teeth. Viewed by millions via pay-per-view television, the Woodstock 1994 performance further aided Green Day's growing publicity and recognition, and helped push its album to eventual diamond status. In 1995, Dookie won the Grammy Award for Best Alternative Album and the band was nominated for 9 MTV Video Music Awards including Video of the Year. The full fold-out artwork to Insomniac, entitled God Told Me to Skin You Alive.  In 1995, a new single for the Angus soundtrack was released, titled \"J.A.R.\". The single went straight to number one on the Billboard Modern Rock Tracks chart. The song was followed by the band's new album, Insomniac, which was released in the fall of 1995. Insomniac was a much darker and heavier response by the band, compared to the poppier, more melodic Dookie. Insomniac opened to a warm critical reception, earning 4 out of 5 stars from Rolling Stone, which said \"In punk, the good stuff actually unfolds and gains meaning as you listen without sacrificing any of its electric, haywire immediacy. And Green Day are as good as this stuff gets.\"Insomniac used a piece of art by Winston Smith entitled God Told Me to Skin You Alive for its album cover. The singles released from Insomniac were \"Geek Stink Breath\", \"Brain Stew/Jaded\", \"Walking Contradiction\", and \"Stuck With Me\". Though the album did not approach the success of Dookie, it still sold two million copies in the United States.Insomniac won the band award nominations for Favorite Artist, Favorite Hard Rock Artist, and Favorite Alternative Artist at the 1996 American Music Awards, and the video for \"Walking Contradiction\" got the band a Grammy nomination for Best Video, Short Form, in addition to a Best Special Effects nomination at the MTV Video Music Awards.[20] After that, the band abruptly cancelled a European tour, citing exhaustion.  Middle era: 1997-2002  After taking a break in 1996, Green Day began to work on a new album in 1997. From the outset, both the band and Cavallo agreed that the album had to be different from its previous records.The result was Nimrod, an experimental deviation from the band's standard pop-punk brand of music. The new album was released in October 1997. It provided a variety of music, from pop-punk, surf rock, and ska, to an acoustic ballad. Nimrod entered the charts at number 10. The success of \"Good Riddance (Time of Your Life)\" won the band an MTV Video Award for Best Alternative Video for the song's video, which depicted people undergoing major changes in their lives while Billie Joe Armstrong strummed his acoustic guitar. The song was also used in the second \"clip show\" episode of Seinfeld and on two episodes of ER. The other singles released from Nimrod were \"Nice Guys Finish Last\", \"Hitchin' a Ride\" and \"Redundant\". The band made a guest appearance in an episode of King of the Hill entitled \"The Man Who Shot Cane Skretteberg\", which aired in 1997.  In 2000, Green Day released Warning, a step further in the style that they had hinted at with Nimrod. Critics' reviews of the album were varied.Allmusic gave it 4.5/5 saying \"Warning may not be an innovative record per se, but it's tremendously satisfying.\" Rolling Stone was more critical, giving it 3/5, and saying \"Warning... invites the question: Who wants to listen to songs of faith, hope and social commentary from what used to be snot-core's biggest-selling band?\" Though it produced the hit \"Minority\" and a smaller hit with \"Warning\", some observers were coming to the conclusion that the band was losing relevance,and a decline in popularity followed. While all of Green Day's past albums had reached a status of at least double platinum, Warning was only certified gold.  At the 2001 California Music Awards, Green Day won all eight awards that they were nominated for. They won the awards for Outstanding Album (Warning), Outstanding Punk Rock/Ska Album (Warning), Outstanding Group, Outstanding Male Vocalist, Outstanding Bassist, Outstanding Drummer, Outstanding Songwriter and Outstanding Artist  The release of a Greatest Hits compilation, International Superhits!, and an assemblage of B-sides, Shenanigans, followed Warning. International Superhits and its companion collection of music videos, International Supervideos!, sold reasonably well, going platinum in the U.S. Shenanigans contained some of the band's b-sides, including \"Espionage\" which was featured in Austin Powers: The Spy Who Shagged Me and was nominated for a Grammy for Best Rock Instrumental Performance.  In the spring of 2002, Green Day co-headlined the Pop Disaster Tour with Blink-182. Despite the co-headlining title, Green Day would play each show before Blink-182, who at the time were experiencing more success. The tour was documented on the DVD Riding In Vans With Boys.  American Idiot and renewed popularity: 2003-2006 Spectators watch Green Day from the grass slopes at the National Bowl.  In the summer of 2003 the band went into a studio to write and record new material for a new album, tentatively titled Cigarettes and Valentines. After completing 20 tracks, the master tapes were stolen from the studio. The band chose not to try to re-create the stolen album, but instead started over. By the end of 2003, Green Day collaborated with Iggy Pop on two tracks for his album Skull Ring. On February 1, 2004 a new song, a cover of \"I Fought the Law\" made its debut on a commercial for iTunes during NFL Super Bowl XXXVIII. The band underwent serious \"band therapy,\" engaging in several long talks to work out the members' differences after accusations from Dirnt and Cool that Armstrong was \"the band's Nazi\" and a show-off bent on taking the limelight from the other band members.  The resulting 2004 album, American Idiot, debuted at number one on the Billboard charts, the band's first ever album to top the chart, backed by the success of the album's first single, \"American Idiot.\" The album was billed as a \"punk rock opera\" which follows the journey of the fictitious \"Jesus of Suburbia\". American Idiot won the 2005 Grammy for \"Best Rock Album\" and the band swept the 2005 MTV music awards, winning a total of seven of the eight awards they were nominated for, including the coveted Viewer's Choice Award.  Through 2005, the band toured in support of the album with about 150 dates -- the longest tour in its career -- visiting Japan, Australia, South America and the United Kingdom, where they drew a crowd of 130,000 people over a span of two days. While touring for American Idiot, they filmed and recorded the two concerts at the Milton Keynes National Bowl in England, which was voted 'The Best Show On Earth' in a Kerrang! Magazine Poll.  These recordings were released as a live CD and DVD called Bullet in a Bible on November 15, 2005. This CD/DVD featured hits from American Idiot as well as a few songs from all its previous albums, except \"Kerplunk\" and \"1,039/Smoothed Out Slappy Hours\". The DVD featured behind-the-scenes footage of the band, and showed how the band prepared to put on the show. The final shows of its 2005 world tour were in Sydney, Australia, and Melbourne, Australia, on December 14 and 17 respectively. On January 10, 2006 the band was awarded with a People's Choice Award for favorite group. Green Day live in Germany during the American Idiot tour.  On August 1, 2005, Green Day announced that that it had rescinded the master rights to its pre-Dookie material from Lookout! Records, citing a continuing breach of contract regarding unpaid royalties, a complaint shared with other Lookout! bands. The pre-Dookie material, which remained out of print for about a year, was reissued by the band's current label, Reprise, on January 9, 2007.  In 2006, Green Day won the Grammy Award for Record of the Year for \"Boulevard of Broken Dreams\" which spent 16 weeks at the number one position of Billboard's Modern Rock Tracks, a record it shared along with Red Hot Chili Peppers' \"Scar Tissue\" and Staind's \"It's Been Awhile,\" (the record has been since been beaten by Foo Fighters' 2007 hit \"The Pretender\" which reigned at the top spot for 18 weeks).  Foxboro Hot Tubs and 21st Century Breakdown: 2007 onward  Green Day engaged in several other smaller projects in the time following the hype of American Idiot. In the spring of 2007, Green Day recorded a cover of the John Lennon song \"Working Class Hero\", which appeared on a compilation album \"Instant Karma\", that benefitted victims in Darfur. In the summer of 2007, Green Day recorded a version of The Simpsons theme song for The Simpsons Movie, as well as having an appearance in the movie.  Green Day recently released a new album under the name Foxboro Hot Tubs entitled Stop Drop and Roll!!!. In an interview with Kerrang!, Billie Joe revealed that 2008 would \"be a fair estimate of the release date of their new untitled eighth studio album.\"In a recent interview with Carson Daly, Garbage lead singer Shirley Manson revealed that Butch Vig would be producing Green Day's forthcoming album. In October 2008 Green Day returned to the studios with Butch Vig, to start recording the new studio album. Two videos showing the band in the studio were posted on YouTube. In the tour section of the band's official website, the message \"World Tour coming soon!\" is shown.In the December 9 issue of Alternative Press, in-depth details about the new album were released. According to the interview, Green Day are recording in the same studio as they did for American Idiot, Ocean Way Recording in Hollywood, California. \"This album is more... religious\", and is influenced by Bob Dylan, Bruce Springsteen, and The Beatles, to name a few.Billie Joe Armstrong said when he was being interviewed for Kerrang!'s readers poll, that it will be more power pop than punk rock.The new album is titled 21st Century Breakdown and was released worldwide on May 15, 2009. Green Day will be going on a world tour starting with North America in July, 2009 until sometime in 2010. Singles from 21st Century Breakdown include Know Your Enemy and 21 Guns.  Musical style and influences  Green Day's sound is often compared to first wave punk bands such as the Ramones, The Clash, Sex Pistols, The Jam, and the Buzzcocks. The majority of their song catalog is composed of distorted guitar, fast, manic drums, and relatively high-treble bass. Most of their songs are fast-paced and under four minutes. Billie Joe Armstrong has mentioned that some of his biggest influences are seminal alternative rock bands H√ºsker D√º and The Replacements, and that their influence is particularly noted in the band's chord changes in songs. In fact, Green Day has covered H√ºsker D√º's \"Don't Want to Know If You Are Lonely\" as a b-side for the \"Warning\" single, and the character \"Mr. Whirly\" in their song \"Misery\" is a reference to the Replacements song of the same name. Among other influences, Green Day have also cited Queen,proto-punks The Who, and power pop pioneers Cheap Trick [46]. Armstrong's lyrics commonly describe alienation, (\"Jesus of Suburbia\", \"Boulevard of Broken Dreams\", \"Road to Acceptance\", \"Disappearing Boy\", \"Castaway\") hysteria (\"Basket Case\", \"Panic Song\"), girls (\"She\", \"80\" \"Only of You\",\"Maria\" \"She's a Rebel\"), growing up (\"Longview\" and \"Welcome to Paradise\"), and the effects of doing drugs (\"Geek Stink Breath\", \"Green Day\"). The Ramones had similar lyrical themes such as hysteria (\"Anxiety\", \"Psycho Therapy\"), alienation (\"Outsider\", \"Something To Believe In\"), girls (\"I Wanna Be Your Boyfriend\", \"Sheena Is a Punk Rocker\"), and drugs (\"Now I Wanna Sniff Some Glue\", \"Chinese Rocks\"). Green Day has covered Ramones songs several times, including recording \"Outsider\" for the tribute album We're a Happy Family, and performing \"Blitzkrieg Bop\" and \"Teenage Lobotomy\" when the Ramones were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2002.  Criticism and controversy  Beginning with the release of Dookie, and the subsequent explosion of MTV airplay it received, Green Day has received considerable criticism from those who see the punk genre as a social movement independent of corporate sponsorship. With the release of American Idiot and the subsequent draw of many new fans, much of this criticism has been revived.  One of the more contentious issues is genre labeling. In reaction to both the style of music and the background of the band, many fans and musicians have taken heavy objection to the usage of the term \"punk\" when applied to Green Day. This is evidenced by the following comments issued by John Lydon (Johnny Rotten), former front man of both the 1970s punk band the Sex Pistols and the 1980s post-punk, Public Image Ltd.: \" So there we are fending off all that and it pisses me off that years later a wank outfit like Green Day hop in and nick all that and attach it to themselves. They didn't earn their wings to do that and if they were true punk they wouldn't look anything like they do. \"  Brandon Flowers of The Killers went on record in 2007 claiming that Green Day's politically driven concept album American Idiot displays \"calculated Anti-Americanism.\" He explained that he has problems with the album content itself and also the fact that the band's recent live DVD, Bullet in a Bible, was filmed in England. The taping of the concert, featured on Bullet in a Bible, shows thousands of Europeans singing along to \"American Idiot.\" Stating that he felt Green Day's DVD is a bit of a stunt, he said, \"I just thought it was really cheap. To go to a place like England or Germany and sing that song - those kids aren't taking it the same way that he meant it. And he (Billie Joe Armstrong) knew it.\"  More recently, Oasis guitarist Noel Gallagher has accused the band of ripping off his song \"Wonderwall\" for \"Boulevard of Broken Dreams\".  Related projects Main article: Green Day related projects  Ever since 1991, some members of the band have branched out past Green Day and have started other projects with other musicians. Notable related projects of Green Day include Billie Joe Armstrong's Pinhead Gunpowder (which also features Green Day's live backup guitarist Jason White), The Frustrators in which Mike Dirnt plays bass, and The Network, in which all three members of Green Day play under fake stage names. Billie Joe Armstrong has also confirmed that the main members of Green Day are in the band Foxboro Hot Tubs. A Foxboro Hot Tubs album titled Stop Drop and Roll!!! was released on 2008-05-20.  Charity projects that the band have been involved with include the collaboration with U2 (\"The Saints Are Coming\") to help raise money for musical instruments lost in Hurricane Katrina, and teaming with the Natural Resources Defense Council for the \"Move America Beyond Oil\" campaign and other environmental concerns.  In September 2006, Green Day teamed up with U2 and producer Rick Rubin to record a cover of the song \"The Saints Are Coming\", originally recorded by The Skids, with an accompanying video. The song is to benefit Music Rising, an organization to help raise money for musicians' instruments lost during Hurricane Katrina, and to bring awareness on the eve of the one year anniversary of the disaster.  \"Working Class Hero\" Play sound \"Working Class Hero\", a cover of a John Lennon song, was released on the Instant Karma CD. Problems listening to this file? See media help.  In December 2006, Green Day and NRDC opened a web site in partnership to raise awareness on America's dependency on oil. (See related projects.)  Green Day released a cover of the John Lennon song \"Working Class Hero\", that was featured on the album Instant Karma: The Amnesty International Campaign to Save Darfur. The band performed the song on the season finale of American Idol. The song was nominated for a Grammy in 2008, but lost to The White Stripes' \"Icky Thump\".  That summer, the band appeared in a cameo role in The Simpsons Movie, where they perform the show's theme song. Their version was released as a single on July 24, 2007.

"text": "Sonny John Moore (born January 15, 1988), better known by his stage name Skrillex, is an American electronic music producer and singer-songwriter. Raised in Northeast Los Angeles and in Northern California, Moore joined the American post-hardcore band From First to Last as the lead singer in 2004, and recorded two studio albums with the band (Dear Diary, My Teen Angst Has a Body Count, 2004, and Heroine, 2006) before leaving to pursue a solo career in 2007. He began his first tour as a solo artist in late 2007. After recruiting a new band lineup, Moore joined the Alternative Press Tour to support bands such as All Time Low and The Rocket Summer, and appeared on the cover of Alternative Press' annual \"100 Bands You Need to Know\" issue. After releasing the Gypsyhook EP in 2009, Moore was scheduled to record his debut studio album, Bells, with producer Noah Shain. However, he ceased production of the album and began performing under the name Skrillex. After releasing the My Name is Skrillex EP for free download on his official MySpace page, he released the Scary Monsters and Nice Sprites EP in late-2010 and More Monsters and Sprites EP in mid-2011. Both have since become moderate commercial successes. On November 30, 2011, he was nominated for a total of five Grammy Awards at the 54th Grammy Awards, including Best New Artist and won three: \"Best Dance/Electronica Album,\" \"Best Dance Recording,\" and \"Best Remixed Recording, Non-Classical\". On December 5, 2011, the BBC announced that he had been nominated for their Sound of 2012 poll. On December 12, 2011, he was also named MTV's Electronic Dance Music Artist of the Year. \n\nBiography:\n\nBackground:\nMoore was born in the Highland Park neighborhood of Northeast Los Angeles, but moved to the Forest Hill neighborhood of San Francisco at the age of two, where he attended elementary school. At the ages of nine and ten, Moore attended a local boarding school located in the Mojave Desert LV, but eventually moved back to Northern California. By the age of twelve, his family moved him back to his birthplace of Northeast L.A., where he enrolled in a private academy school specializing in arts, and was then later home schooled at the age of fourteen due to bullying. In 2004, he learned he was adopted and dropped out of the program when he was sixteen years old. While a young teenager in Los Angeles, Moore would attend punk gigs in Mexican American neighborhoods in East and South Los Angeles, and later on electro club raves in the downtown's Silver Lake and Echo Park neighborhoods. \n\nFrom First to Last (2004-07):\nIn 2004, Moore contacted Matt Good of From First to Last about playing guitar for the band on their debut album. After flying out to Georgia, Moore was heard singing by three studio producers, Derrick Thomas, Eric Dale, and McHale Butler, and was then made lead singer, with Good playing guitar. In June 2004, Epitaph Records released the band's first full-length record with their new bandmate, Dear Diary, My Teen Angst Has a Body Count. After performing on several successful tours, two being the Vans Warped Tour and Dead by Dawn tour, they began recording their second album, Heroine with producer Ross Robinson. The album was released in March 2006 on Epitaph. With high record sales once again, the band found themselves part of many successful tours, until Moore started suffering vocal problems, causing the band to resign from several tours. After going through a successful vocal surgical procedure, Moore informed the band he would be permanently resigning to work on a solo career. FFTL's last show performed with Moore was in their hometown of Orlando at The House of Blues while touring with Atreyu. \n\nSolo career (2007-present):\n\nMoore announced he had left From First to Last to pursue a solo career. He then launched a Myspace page displaying three demos (\"Signal\", \"Equinox\", and \"Glow Worm\"). This led to Moore's first performance since his leaving From First to Last. On April 7, 2007, alongside harpist Carol Robbins, Moore played several original songs at a local art building. After months of releasing demos via Myspace, Moore played on the Team Sleep Tour with a full band. The tour also featured supporting acts Monster in the Machine and Strata. Moore made several demo CDs available on this tour, limited to about 30 per show. These CDs were tour exclusive, and were packaged in \"baby blue envelopes\", each with a unique drawing by Moore or bandmate. In February 2008, Alternative Press Magazine announced the second annual AP Tour, with All Time Low, The Rocket Summer, The Matches, and Forever the Sickest Kids, as well as Sonny Moore. The tour started in Houston, Texas on March 14 and went through North America, ending in Cleveland, Ohio on May 2, with the majority of the shows being sold out. All bands playing the tour would be featured on the cover of Alternative Press Magazine's annual 100 Bands You Need to Know special, and would be interviewed on the Alternative Press Podcast. During this tour Moore's line-up consisted of Sean Friday on drums, Christopher Null on guitar, and Aaron Rothe on keyboards. On April 7, 2009, he released Gypsyhook EP, a digital EP, which featured three songs and four remixes. Also included was a Japanese version of \"Mora\" entitled \"Êµ∑Ê∞¥\" (\"Kaisui\"). Physical copies of the EP were available at his shows. After going on tour with Innerpartysystem and Paper Route and opening for Chiodos on their European tour, Moore performed at Bamboozle on May 2. He performed on Bamboozle Left's Saints and Sinners stage on April 4. He toured with Hollywood Undead in April 2009 performing under the band name Sonny and the Blood Monkeys, with Chris Null (electric guitar), Sean Friday (drums, percussion & beats) and Aaron Rothe (keyboards, synthesizers, programming & turntables) Although no official statement has been given regarding the album, Moore has stated that Bells will no longer be released. \n\nProduction career:\n\nIn 2008, Moore began producing and performing under the alias Skrillex at clubs in the Los Angeles area. Previously, he had been known on the Internet as Twipz. On June 7, 2010, Moore released his official Skrillex debut EP, My Name is Skrillex as a free download. Moore provided programming and vocals for UK metalcore band Bring Me the Horizon on their third studio album, There Is a Hell, Believe Me I've Seen It. There Is a Heaven, Let's Keep It a Secret. Later in the year, Sonny began a nationwide tour with Deadmau5 after being signed to mau5trap recordings and released his second EP, Scary Monsters and Nice Sprites. Moore kicked off the \"Project Blue Book Tour\" in 2011 with support from Porter Robinson, Tommy Lee and DJ Aero as well as appearances from Sofia Toufa for a new song titled \"Bring out the Devil.\" Skrillex unveiled several new songs on this tour including \"First Of The Year\" (formerly known as \"Equinox\"), \"Reptile\", and \"Cinema\" (remix of a Benny Benassi track). \"Reptile\" was featured in the TV commercial for Mortal Kombat 9, and \"First of the Year (Equinox)\" is featured on his follow up EP and remix companion to Scary Monsters and Nice Sprites, titled More Monsters and Sprites. In April 2011, Spin magazine premiered \"Get Up\", an exclusive new track from Korn that was produced by Skrillex. Korn made \"Get Up\" available for free download via their Facebook page. On April 15, 2011 KoRn joined Skrillex on stage for his set at Coachella 2011. On April 18, 2011, Sony Computer Entertainment (SCEA) development studio Naughty Dog released a trailer for the multiplayer component of their PlayStation 3 game Uncharted 3: Drake's Deception, featuring \"Kill EVERYBODY\" from Scary Monsters and Nice Sprites. In June 2011, \"More Monsters and Sprites\" was released on Beatport, an EP consisting of three original tracks, including \"First of the Year (Equinox)\" and two versions of his original track \"Ruffneck\". A leaked track entitled \"Ruffneck Bass\" had been leaked on the internet months prior which used the same sample as in the new \"Ruffneck\" tracks on the EP. Skrillex released a music video for \"Rock n' Roll (Will Take You to the Mountain)\" on his official YouTube page on June 20, 2011. \n\nOn August 17, 2011 Skrillex announced his label, OWSLA. \"The label's first releases will come from Bristol-based dubstep producer Koan Sound, electro-house newcomer Porter Robinson from North Carolina, singer/songwriter Alvin Risk, and San Francisco-based M Machine (formally Metropolis).\" Skrillex released a music video for \"First of the Year (Equinox)\" via Spin.com on August 19, 2011. In late August 2011 it was released that he would be appearing Knife Party's first release, collaborating on a Moombahton style track entitled \"Zoology\". A preview was released on YouTube. In late September 2011 he created the track \"Syndicate\" as promotion for the video game of the same name. Kaskade's 2011 album Fire & Ice features a collaboration between Kaskade and Skrillex entitled \"Lick It\". The video for Skrillex's song \"First of the Year (Equinox)\" appears on the first episode of the Beavis and Butt-head revival. On November 8, Skrillex stated that he intended to release an album entitled Voltage. Skrillex gave fans more info about Voltage in RockSound Magazine after a photoshoot for the cover and doing an extensive interview on his tour. For unknown reasons, however, the album was never released. On December 21, 2011, Skrillex unveiled the Bangarang EP for a Beatport release on December 23. On March 13, 2012, Beatport released OWSLA's second Free Treats sampler, Free Treats Vol. 2. The 19-track compilation features \"Ruffneck (FULL Flex) Munchi Anonymous Revolution Remix\", a remixed track by Skrillex. This new take on the track deviates from the original (released on the More Monsters and Sprites EP), with the remix being more characteristic of Electro House, though with a much slower tempo of 108 BPM, versus the original version's classic Dubstep tempo of 140 BPM, also straying from the typical Electro House tempo of 128 BPM. On August 12, 2012, his new side-project formed with Boys Noize called Dog Blood released an EP called Next Order/Middle Finger. \n\nInfluences:\nMoore has stated in an online interview that he has been a longtime fan of Warp, an electronic music label that has released recordings from artists such as Aphex Twin and Squarepusher. \n\nPersonal life:\nAs of February 2012, Skrillex has been dating fellow artist and singer, Ellie Goulding, who provided vocals for the Skrillex track, \"Summit\", featured on the EP, Bangarang.",

"text": "Green Day is an American punk rock band formed in 1987. The band consists of lead vocalist and guitarist Billie Joe Armstrong, bassist and backing vocalist Mike Dirnt, and drummer Tre Cool. Cool replaced former drummer John Kiffmeyer in 1990, prior to the recording of the band's second studio album, Kerplunk (1992). Green Day was originally part of the punk scene at 924 Gilman Street in Berkeley, California. The band's early releases were from the independent record label Lookout! Records. In 1994, its major label debut Dookie released through Reprise Records became a breakout success and eventually sold over 10 million copies in the U.S. Green Day was widely credited, alongside fellow California punk bands Sublime,The Offspring and Rancid, with popularizing and reviving mainstream interest in punk rock in the United States. Green Day's three follow-up albums, Insomniac (1995), Nimrod (1997), and Warning (2000) did not achieve the massive success of Dookie, though they were still successful, with Insomniac and Nimrod reaching double platinum and Warning reaching gold status. The band's rock opera, American Idiot (2004), reignited the band's popularity with a younger generation, selling five million copies in the United States. The band's eighth studio album, 21st Century Breakdown, was released in 2009 which achieved the band's best chart performance to date. The band will begin to release a trilogy of albums called ¬°Uno!, ¬°Dos!, and ¬°Tr√©!, to be released September 25, 2012, November 13, 2012, and January 15, 2013 respectively. Green Day has sold over 65 million records worldwide with 25 million in the US alone. The group has won five Grammy Awards: Best Alternative Album for Dookie, Best Rock Album for American Idiot, Record of the Year for \"Boulevard of Broken Dreams\", Best Rock Album for the second time for 21st Century Breakdown and Best Musical Show Album for American Idiot: The Original Broadway Cast Recording. In 2010, a stage adaptation of American Idiot debuted on Broadway. The musical was nominated for several Tony Awards, including Best Musical and Best Scenic Design. \n\nHistory:\n\nFormation and Lookout! years (1987-1993):\nIn 1987, friends Billie Joe Armstrong and Mike Dirnt, 15 years old at the time, formed a band called Sweet Children. Its first live performance took place on October 17, 1987 at Rod's Hickory Pit in Vallejo, California. In 1988, Armstrong and Dirnt began working with Sean Hughes and the former Isocracy drummer John Kiffmeyer, also known as \"Al Sobrante\". As said in the film Punk's Not Dead, Armstrong cites the band Operation Ivy (which featured Tim Armstrong and Matt Freeman of Rancid) as a major influence, and a group that inspired him to form a band. In 1988, Larry Livermore, owner of Lookout! Records, saw the band play an early show and signed the group to his label. In 1989, the band recorded its debut extended play, 1,000 Hours. Before 1,000 Hours was released, the group dropped the name Sweet Children; according to Livermore, this was done to avoid confusion with another local band Sweet Baby. The band adopted the name Green Day, due to their fondness for marijuana. Lookout! would release Green Day's debut studio album, 39/Smooth in early 1990. Green Day would record two extended plays later that year, Slappy and Sweet Children, the latter of which included older songs that the band had recorded for the Minneapolis independent record label Skene! Records. In 1991, Lookout! Records re-released 39/Smooth under the name 1,039/Smoothed Out Slappy Hours, and added the songs from the band's first two EPs, Slappy, and 1,000 Hours. In late 1990, shortly after the band's first nationwide tour, Sobrante left the East Bay area to attend college.The Lookouts drummer Tre Cool began filling in as a temporary replacement and later Cool's position as Green Day's drummer became permanent. The band went on tour for most of 1992 and 1993, and played a number of shows overseas in Europe. The band's second studio album Kerplunk sold 50,000 copies in the U.S. \n\nBreakthrough success (1994-1996):\n\nKerplunk's underground success led to a number of major record labels being interested in signing Green Day, and the band eventually left Lookout! and signed to Reprise Records after attracting the attention of producer Rob Cavallo. The group was impressed by his work with fellow Californian band The Muffs, and later remarked that Cavallo \"was the only person we could really talk to and connect with\". Reflecting on the period, Armstrong told Spin magazine in 1999, \"I couldn't go back to the punk scene, whether we were the biggest success in the world or the biggest failure ... The only thing I could do was get on my bike and go forward.\" After signing with Reprise, the band went to work on recording its major label debut, Dookie. Recorded in three weeks, and released in February 1994,Dookie became a commercial success, helped by extensive MTV airplay for the videos of the songs \"Longview\", \"Basket Case\", and \"When I Come Around\", all of which reached the number one position on the Modern Rock Tracks charts. That year, Green Day embarked on a nationwide tour with queercore band Pansy Division as its opening act. At a September 9, 1994 performance at Hatch Memorial Shell in Boston, mayhem broke-out during the band's set (cut short to seven songs) and by the end of the rampage, 100 people were injured and 45 arrested. The band also joined the lineups of both the Lollapalooza festival and Woodstock '94, where they started an infamous mud fight. During the concert, a security guard mistook bassist Mike Dirnt for a stage-invading fan and punched out some of his teeth. Viewed by millions by pay-per-view television, the Woodstock 1994 performance further aided Green Day's growing publicity and recognition, and helped push its album to eventual diamond status. In 1995, Dookie won the Grammy Award for Best Alternative Album and the band was nominated for nine MTV Video Music Awards including Video of the Year. In 1995, a new single for the Angus soundtrack was released, entitled \"J.A.R.\". The single debuted at number one on the Billboard Modern Rock Tracks chart. The song was followed by the band's fourth studio album, Insomniac, which was released in the fall of 1995. Insomniac was a much darker and heavier response to the band's newfound popularity, compared to the more melodic Dookie. The album opened to a warm critical reception, earning 4 out of 5 stars from Rolling Stone, which said \"In punk, the good stuff actually unfolds and gains meaning as you listen without sacrificing any of its electric, haywire immediacy. And Green Day are as good as this stuff gets.\" The singles released from Insomniac were \"Geek Stink Breath\", \"Stuck with Me\", \"Brain Stew/Jaded\", and \"Walking Contradiction\". Though the album did not approach the success of Dookie, it sold two million copies in the United States. In addition, the album won the band award nominations for Favorite Artist, Favorite Hard Rock Artist, and Favorite Alternative Artist at the 1996 American Music Awards, and the video for \"Walking Contradiction\" got the band a Grammy nomination for Best Video, Short Form, in addition to a Best Special Effects nomination at the MTV Video Music Awards. After that, the band abruptly cancelled a European tour, citing exhaustion. \n\nMiddle years and decline in commercial success (1997-2002):\nAfter a brief hiatus in 1996, Green Day began to work on a new album in 1997. From the outset, both the band and Cavallo agreed that the album had to be different from its previous albums. The result was Nimrod, an experimental deviation from the band's standard pop-punk brand of music. The new album was released in October 1997. It provided a variety of music, from pop-punk, surf rock, and ska, to an acoustic ballad. Nimrod entered the charts at number 10. The success of \"Good Riddance (Time of Your Life)\" won the band an MTV Video Award for Best Alternative Video. The song was also used in the second \"clip show\" episode of Seinfeld and on two episodes of ER. The other singles released from Nimrod were \"Nice Guys Finish Last\", \"Hitchin' a Ride\" and \"Redundant\". The band made a guest appearance in an episode of King of the Hill entitled \"The Man Who Shot Cane Skretteberg\", which aired in 1997. In late 1997 and most of 1998, Green Day embarked on a tour in support of Nimrod. In 2000, Green Day released its sixth studio album Warning. In support of the album, the band participated in the Warped Tour in 2000. The band also had an independent tour to support the album in 2001. Critics' reviews of the album were varied.Allmusic gave it 4.5/5 saying \"Warning may not be an innovative record per se, but it's tremendously satisfying.\"Rolling Stone was more critical, giving it 3/5, and saying \"Warning... invites the question: Who wants to listen to songs of faith, hope and social commentary from what used to be snot-core's biggest-selling band?\" Though it produced the hit \"Minority\" and a smaller hit with \"Warning\", some observers were coming to the conclusion that the band was losing relevance, and a decline in popularity followed. While all of Green Day's previous albums had reached a status of at least double platinum, Warning was only certified gold. At the 2001 California Music Awards, Green Day won all eight of the awards that it was nominated for. The group won the awards for Outstanding Album (Warning), Outstanding Punk Rock/Ska Album (Warning), Outstanding Group, Outstanding Male Vocalist, Outstanding Bassist, Outstanding Drummer, Outstanding Songwriter, and Outstanding Artist. The release of two compilation albums, International Superhits! and Shenanigans, followed Warning. International Superhits and its companion collection of music videos, International Supervideos!. Shenanigans contained some of the band's b-sides, including \"Espionage\", which was featured in the film Austin Powers: The Spy Who Shagged Me and was nominated for a Grammy Award for Best Rock Instrumental Performance. In the spring of 2002, Green Day co-headlined the Pop Disaster Tour with Blink-182 which was documented on the DVD Riding in Vans with Boys. \n\nAmerican Idiot and renewed success (2003-2006):\n\nIn the summer of 2003, the band went into a studio to write and record new material for a new album, tentatively titled Cigarettes and Valentines. After completing 20 tracks, the master recordings were stolen from the studio. Instead of re-recording the stolen tracks, the band decided to abandon the entire project and start over, considering the material to be unrepresentative of the band's best work. It was then revealed that a band called The Network was signed to Armstrong's record label Adeline Records with little fanfare and information. After the mysterious band released an album called Money Money 2020, it was rumored that The Network was a Green Day side project, due to the similarities in the bands' sounds. However, these rumors were never addressed by the band or Adeline Records, except for a statement on the Adeline website discussing an ongoing dispute between the two bands. Green Day collaborated with Iggy Pop on two tracks for his album Skull Ring in November 2003. On February 1, 2004 a new song, a cover of \"I Fought the Law\" made its debut on a commercial for iTunes during NFL Super Bowl XXXVIII. \n\nThe resulting album, American Idiot (2004), debuted at number one on the Billboard charts, the band's first album to reach number one, backed by the success of the album's first single, American Idiot. The album was labeled as a punk rock opera which follows the journey of the fictitious Jesus of Suburbia.American Idiot won the 2005 Grammy for Best Rock Album. The band also won a total of seven awards out of eight awards for which they were nominated, including the Viewer's Choice Award in MTV Video Music Awards 2005. Through 2005, the band toured in support of the album with nearly 150 dates (Longest tour in their career) visiting Japan, Australia, South America and the United Kingdom. While touring for American Idiot, they filmed and recorded the two concerts at the Milton Keynes National Bowl in England, which was voted 'The Best Show On Earth' in a Kerrang! Magazine Poll. These recordings were released as a live CD and DVD called Bullet in a Bible on November 15, 2005. This CD/DVD featured songs from American Idiot as well as songs from all its previous albums, except Kerplunk and 1,039/Smoothed Out Slappy Hours. The DVD featured behind-the-scenes footage of the band, and showed how the band prepared to put on the show. The final shows of its 2005 world tour were in Sydney and Melbourne in Australia, on December 14 and 17 respectively. On August 1, 2005, Green Day announced that it had rescinded the master rights to its pre-Dookie material from Lookout! Records, citing a continuing breach of contract regarding unpaid royalties, a complaint shared with other Lookout! bands. On January 10, 2006 the band was awarded with a People's Choice Award as favorite musical group or band. \n\n21st Century Breakdown and American Idiot: The Musical (2006-2010):\nGreen Day engaged in a number of other smaller projects in the time following the success of American Idiot. The group released an album under the name Foxboro Hot Tubs entitled Stop Drop and Roll!!!. In 2008, the Foxboro Hot Tubs went on a mini-tour to promote the record, hitting tiny Bay Area venues including the Stork Club in Oakland and Toot's Tavern in Crockett, CA. \n\nIn an interview with Carson Daly, Garbage lead singer Shirley Manson revealed that Butch Vig would be producing Green Day's forthcoming album. The span of nearly five years between American Idiot and 21st Century Breakdown was the longest gap between studio albums in Green Day's career. The band had been working on new material since January 2006. By October 2007, Armstrong had 45 songs written, but the band showed no further signs of progress until October 2008, when two videos showing the band recording in the studio with producer Butch Vig were posted on YouTube. The writing and recording process, spanning three years and four recording studios, was finally finished in April 2009. 21st Century Breakdown, was released on May 15, 2009. The album received a mainly positive reception from critics, getting an average rating between 3 and 4 stars. After the release, the album reached number one in fourteen countries, being certified gold or platinum in each. 21st Century Breakdown achieved Green Day's best chart performance to date. The band started playing shows in California in April and early May. It was their first live show in about three years. Green Day went on a world tour that started in North America in July 2009 and continuing around the world throughout the rest of 2009 and early 2010.Wal-Mart refused to carry the album as it contains a Parental Advisory sticker and requested that Green Day release a censored edition. The band members did not wish to change any lyrics on the album and responded by stating, \"There's nothing dirty about our record... They want artists to censor their records in order to be carried in there. We just said no. We've never done it before. You feel like you're in 1953 or something.\" In 2009, the band met with award-winning director Michael Mayer and many cast and crew members of the Tony Award-winning musical Spring Awakening to create a stage version of the album American Idiot.American Idiot: The Musical opened in the Berkeley Repertory Theatre during the end of 2009. The show features an expanded story of the original album, with new characters such as Will, Extraordinary Girl, and Favorite Son. On April 20, 2010, American Idiot: The Musical opened on Broadway, and Green Day released the soundtrack to the musical, featuring a new song by Green Day entitled \"When It's Time\". In June 2010 the iTunes received the single \"When It's Time\". During the Spike TV Video Game Awards 2009, it was announced that Green Day was set to have its own Rock Band video game titled as Green Day: Rock Band, as a follow-up to the last band specific Rock Band game, The Beatles: Rock Band. The game features the full albums of Dookie, American Idiot, and 21st Century Breakdown as well as select songs from the rest of Green Day's discography. During the second leg of the 21st Century Breakdown World Tour the band had said that they are writing new material. In an interview with Kerrang! magazine, Armstrong spoke about the possible new album: \"We did some demos in Berlin, some in Stockholm, some just outside of Glasgow and some in Amsterdam. We wanted get the songs down in some early form.\" The band also stated that they were recording a live album during the entire tour on the last date of the tour in Mountain View, California, also before playing the song \"Cigarettes and Valentines\". In October 2010, Dirnt was interviewed by Radio W, mentioning that they have completed the writing process of the ninth studio album. In the interview, Dirnt also mentioned that a new live album will \"most likely\" be released. The live CD/DVD and CD/Blu-ray entitled Awesome as Fuck was released on March 22, 2011. \n\n¬°Uno!, ¬°Dos!, and ¬°Tr√©! (2011-present):\nOn August 11, 2011, Green Day played a secret show in Costa Mesa, California, and performed an entire set of over 15 new songs allegedly for a possible upcoming album. Green Day put a news post on their official website which read \"Thanks everyone for coming out to the show...\" and \"Stay tuned for more\". It also included lyrics to a new song that was played at the show called \"Amy\" which is dedicated to Amy Winehouse, who died weeks before the show. In February 2012, Armstrong announced through Twitter that the band were in the studio, recording material for a new album. On February 24, 2012, the band began uploading behind the scenes videos of the recording of the new album to YouTube. On April 11, singer Billie Joe Armstrong announced that Green Day would be releasing a trilogy of albums called ¬°Uno!, ¬°Dos!, and ¬°Tr√©!. Armstrong stated that they would be released on September 25, 2012, November 13, 2012, and January 15, 2013 respectively. On June 14, 2012, Green Day released the official artwork of the album ¬°Uno! on YouTube and Facebook. Armstrong in a talk with Rolling Stone Magazine confirmed that each album will have a member of the band on its cover. The ¬°Uno! ¬°Dos! ¬°Tr√©! Ultimate Box Set has also been announced by Warner Bros. Records and will contain all three albums, as well as various other content, such as three digital singles and a one year online membership or renewal to the Idiot Club. The band played at the Rock En Seine festival in France on August 24-26, 2012, the Rock am See festival in Germany on September 1, 2012 and the Reading festival in the UK. The band has also announced a US tour supporting the trilogy, from November 2012 through February 2013. ¬°Uno! was released on September 24, 2012 and has been met with generally favorable reviews. \n\nMusical style and influences:\n\nGreen Day's sound is often compared to first wave punk bands such as the Ramones, The Clash, Sex Pistols, and the Buzzcocks. Citing the band's musical style prevalent on Dookie, Stephen Erlewine of Allmusic described Green Day as \"punk revivalists who recharged the energy of speedy, catchy three-chord punk-pop songs.\" While Armstrong is the primary songwriter, he looks to the other band members for organizational help. Billie Joe Armstrong has mentioned that some of his biggest influences are seminal alternative rock bands H√ºsker D√º and The Replacements, and that their influence is particularly noted in the band's chord changes in songs. Green Day has covered H√ºsker D√º's \"Don't Want to Know If You Are Lonely\" as a b-side to the \"Warning\" single, and the character \"Mr. Whirly\" in their song \"Misery\" is a reference to the Replacements song of the same name. Among other influences, Green Day have also cited The Who and power pop pioneers Cheap Trick. The band has generated controversy over whether the band's musical style and major-label status constitutes as \"true punk\". In reaction to both the style of music and the background of the band, John Lydon, former front man of the 1970s punk band the Sex Pistols commented: \n\"So there we are fending off all that and it pisses me off that years later a wank outfit like Green Day hop in and nick all that and attach it to themselves. They didn't earn their wings to do that and if they were true punk they wouldn't look anything like they do.\" \nArmstrong himself has discussed the group's status of being a punk band on a major record label, saying \"Sometimes I think we've become totally redundant because we're this big band now, we've made a lot of money - we're not punk rock any more. But then I think about it and just say, 'You can take us out of a punk rock environment, but you can't take the punk rock out of us.'\" English rock musician Noel Gallagher of Oasis also complained about the band semi-jokingly, claiming that they ripped off his song \"Wonderwall\" with their song \"Boulevard of Broken Dreams\". \n\nRelated projects:\nSince 1991, members of the band have branched out past Green Day and have started other projects with other musicians. Notable related projects of Green Day include Billie Joe Armstrong's Pinhead Gunpowder (which also features Green Day's live back-up guitarist Jason White), The Frustrators in which Mike Dirnt plays bass, and The Network, a collaboration between Green Day and members of the band, Devo in which all members play under fake stage names. Green Day has also released an album titled Stop Drop and Roll!!! on May 20, 2008, under the name Foxboro Hot Tubs, they currently use this name to book secret shows. In late December 2011, Armstrong formed a new side band called The Boo along his wife Adrienne and their two sons. In September 2006, Green Day collaborated with U2 and producer Rick Rubin to record a cover of the song \"The Saints Are Coming\", originally recorded by The Skids, with an accompanying video. The song was recorded to benefit Music Rising, an organization to help raise money for musicians' instruments lost during Hurricane Katrina, and to bring awareness on the eve of the one year anniversary of the disaster. In December 2006, Green Day and NRDC opened a web site in partnership to raise awareness on America's dependency on oil. Green Day released a cover of the John Lennon song \"Working Class Hero\", which was featured on the album Instant Karma: The Amnesty International Campaign to Save Darfur. The band performed the song on the season finale of American Idol. The song was nominated for a Grammy Award in 2008, though lost to The White Stripes' \"Icky Thump\". That summer, the band appeared in a cameo role in The Simpsons Movie, where they perform the show's theme song. Their version was released as a single on July 24, 2007. In 2009, the band collaborated with theatre director Michael Mayer to adapt their rock opera American Idiot into a one-act stage musical that premiered at the Berkeley Rep on September 15, 2009. The show then moved to Broadway on April 20, 2010. The reviews of American Idiot: The Musical have been positive to mixed. Charles Isherwood of The New York Times wrote an enthusiastic review for the Broadway production. He called the show \"a pulsating portrait of wasted youth that invokes all the standard genre conventions ... only to transcend them through the power of its music and the artistry of its execution, the show is as invigorating and ultimately as moving as anything I've seen on Broadway this season. Or maybe for a few seasons past.\" Jed Gottlieb of the Boston Herald enjoyed the premise of the show but found that \"the music and message suffer in a setting where the audience is politely, soberly seated\". Michael Kuchiwara of the Associated Press found the show to be \"visually striking and musically adventurous\", but noted that \"the show has the barest wisp of a story and minimal character development\". Paul Kolnik in USA Today enjoyed the contradiction that Green Day's \"massively popular, starkly disenchanted album ... would be the feel-good musical of the season\". Time magazine's Richard Zoglin opined that the score \"is as pure a specimen of contemporary punk rock as Broadway has yet encountered yet there's enough variety. ... Where the show fall short is as a fully developed narrative.\" He concluded that \"American Idiot, despite its earnest huffing and puffing, remains little more than an annotated rock concert. ... Still, it deserves at least two cheers - for its irresistible musical energy and for opening fresh vistas for that odd couple, rock and Broadway.\" Peter Travers from Rolling Stone, in his review of American Idiot, wrote \"Though American Idiot carries echoes of such rock musicals as Tommy, Hair, Rent and Spring Awakening, it cuts its own path to the heart. You won't know what hit you. American Idiot knows no limits--it's a global knockout.\" The musical has been nominated for a number of Tony Awards, including Best Musical and Best Scenic Design. It was also nominated for a number of Drama Desk Awards and Outer Critics Circle Awards. In October 2009, a Green Day art project was exhibited at StolenSpace Gallery in London. The exhibition showed artworks created for each of the songs on 21st Century Breakdown, was supported by the band, and led by their manager Pat Magnarella. He explained in an interview that \"Artists are basically like rock bands. Most are creating their art, but don't know how to promote it.\" For Billie Joe Armstrong, \"Many of the artists... show their work on the street, and we feel a strong connection to that type of creative expression.\" On April 13, 2011, a film version of American Idiot was confirmed. Michael Mayer, director of the Broadway musical, will be directing the film. It will be produced by Green Day, Pat Magnarella (Green Day's manager who also produced Bullet in a Bible, Awesome as Fuck, and Heart Like a Hand Grenade), Playtone (Tom Hanks and Gary Goetzman) and Tom Hulce. \n\nInvolvement in politics and social justice:\nWhen asked his opinion regarding whether all musicians ought to try to add a social or political message to their work, Armstrong replied that \" \nThe only people who should sing about social issues or politics are the ones who aren't full of shit. \n\" \n American Idiot was released two months before former President of the United States George W. Bush was reelected, and as a result the album became protest art. Created as an anti-war album, American Idiot contains many new-age protest songs, like Holiday which was against George Bush's decision to invade Iraq. Armstrong described the song as a means by which \"to battle your way out of your own ignorance\". \n\nBand members:\n\nCurrent members \nBillie Joe Armstrong - lead vocals, guitar, piano, harmonica (1987-present), \nMike Dirnt - bass, backing vocals (1988-present), rhythm guitar (1987-1988), \nTr√© Cool - drums, percussion, backing vocals (1990-present), \nSession and touring members \nJason White - lead and rhythm guitars, backing vocals (1999-present), \nJason Freese - keyboards, piano, saxophone, trombone, backing vocals (2003-present), \nJeff Matika - rhythm guitar, acoustic guitar, backing vocals (2009-present), \n\nFormer members \nJohn Kiffmeyer - drums, percussion (1987-1990), \nSean Hughes - bass (1987-1988), \nFormer touring members \nTimmy Chunks - guitars (1997-1999), \nGarth Schultz - trombone, trumpet (1997-1999), \nGabrial McNair - trombone, tenor saxophone (1999-2001), \nJeanne Geiger - trombone (2001), \nKurt Lohmiller - trumpet, timpani, percussion, backing vocals (1999-2004), \nMike Pelino - rhythm guitar, backing vocals (2004-2005), \nRonnie Blake - trumpet, timpani, percussion, backing vocals (2004-2005)",

"text": "Green Day is an American rock trio formed in 1987. The band has consisted of Billie Joe Armstrong (vocals, guitar), Mike Dirnt (bass guitar, vocals), and Tr√© Cool (drums, percussion) for the majority of its existence.  Green Day was originally part of the punk rock scene at 924 Gilman Street, Berkeley in  East Bay, CA, United States . Its early releases for independent record label Lookout! Records earned them a grassroots fanbase, some of whom felt alienated when the band signed to a major label. Nevertheless, its major label debut Dookie (1994) became a breakout success and eventually sold over 10 million copies in the US. and 15 million worldwide. As a result, Green Day was widely credited, alongside fellow California punk bands The Offspring and Rancid, with reviving mainstream interest in and popularizing punk rock in the United States. Green Day's three follow-up albums, Insomniac, Nimrod and Warning did not achieve the massive success of Dookie, but they were still successful, reaching double platinum, double platinum, and gold status respectively. Green Day's 2004 rock opera American Idiot reignited the band's popularity with a younger generation, selling five million copies in the U.S.The band's eighth studio album, 21st Century Breakdown, was released on May 15, 2009.  Green Day has sold over 22 million records in the United States.They have won three Grammy Awards; Best Alternative Album for Dookie, Best Rock Album for American Idiot, and Record of the Year for Boulevard of Broken Dreams.  In 1987, friends Billie Joe Armstrong and Mike Dirnt, 15 years old at the time, formed a band called Sweet Children. The first Sweet Children show took place on October 17, 1987, at Rod's Hickory Pit in Vallejo, California where Armstrong's mother was working.In 1988, Armstrong and Dirnt began working with former Isocracy drummer, John Kiffmeyer (also known as Al Sobrante). Kiffmeyer served as both the band's drummer and business manager, handling the booking of shows and helping the band establish a fan base.  Larry Livermore, owner of Lookout! Records, saw the band play an early show and signed them to his label. In 1989 they recorded their first EP, 1,000 Hours. Before 1,000 Hours was released, the band dropped the name Sweet Children, according to Livermore this was done in order to avoid confusion with another local band Sweet Baby.The band adopted the name Green Day, allegedly due to their fondness of marijuana.  Lookout! would release Green Day's first LP, 39/Smooth in early 1990. Green Day would record two EPs later that year: Slappy and Sweet Children, the latter of which included some older songs they had recorded for Minneapolis indie label Skene! Records. In 1991, Lookout! Records released 1,039/Smoothed Out Slappy Hours, a compilation of the 39/Smooth, Slappy, and 1,000 Hours EPs. In late 1990, shortly after the band's first nationwide tour, Sobrante left the East Bay area to attend college. The Lookouts drummer Tr√© Cool began filling in as a temporary replacement, and when it became clear that Sobrante did not plan on committing to the band full time, Tr√© Cool's position as Green Day's drummer became permanent. The band went on tour for most of 1992 and 1993, and played a stretch of shows overseas in Europe. The band's second full length album Kerplunk sold about 50,000 copies in the U.S., which was considered quite a large amount for the independent punk scene in 1992.  Kerplunk's underground success led to a wave of interest coming from major record labels, and eventually they left Lookout! on friendly terms and signed with Reprise Records after attracting the attention of producer Rob Cavallo. Signing to Reprise caused many punk rock fans to regard Green Day as sellouts.Reflecting on the period, Armstrong told SPIN magazine in 1999, \"I couldn't go back to the punk scene, whether we were the biggest success in the world or the biggest failure ... The only thing I could do was get on my bike and go forward.\" After signing with Reprise, the band went to work on recording its major label debut, Dookie.  \"Longview\" Play sound Sample of \"Longview\", the first single from Dookie, which combined a memorable bass line with a guitar riff and drums introduced in the chorus. Problems listening to this file? See media help.  \"Basket Case\" Play sound Sample of \"Basket Case\", the third single from Dookie, which was about Armstrong's panic attacks. Problems listening to this file? See media help.  Released in February 1994, and recorded in 3 weeks,Dookie became a commercial success, helped by extensive MTV airplay for the videos of the songs \"Longview\", \"Basket Case\", and \"When I Come Around\", all of which reached the number one position on the Modern Rock Tracks charts. That year, Green Day embarked on a nationwide tour with queercore band Pansy Division as its opening act. At a September 9, 1994 concert at Boston Esplanade, mayhem broke-out during the band's set (cut short to seven songs) and by the end of the rampage, 100 people were injured and 45 arrested. The band also joined the lineups of both the Lollapalooza festival and Woodstock 1994, where they started an infamous mud fight. During the concert, a security guard mistook bassist Mike Dirnt for a stage-invading fan and punched out some of his teeth. Viewed by millions via pay-per-view television, the Woodstock 1994 performance further aided Green Day's growing publicity and recognition, and helped push its album to eventual diamond status. In 1995, Dookie won the Grammy Award for Best Alternative Album and the band was nominated for 9 MTV Video Music Awards including Video of the Year. The full fold-out artwork to Insomniac, entitled God Told Me to Skin You Alive.  In 1995, a new single for the Angus soundtrack was released, titled \"J.A.R.\". The single went straight to number one on the Billboard Modern Rock Tracks chart. The song was followed by the band's new album, Insomniac, which was released in the fall of 1995. Insomniac was a much darker and heavier response by the band, compared to the poppier, more melodic Dookie. Insomniac opened to a warm critical reception, earning 4 out of 5 stars from Rolling Stone, which said \"In punk, the good stuff actually unfolds and gains meaning as you listen without sacrificing any of its electric, haywire immediacy. And Green Day are as good as this stuff gets.\"Insomniac used a piece of art by Winston Smith entitled God Told Me to Skin You Alive for its album cover. The singles released from Insomniac were \"Geek Stink Breath\", \"Brain Stew/Jaded\", \"Walking Contradiction\", and \"Stuck With Me\". Though the album did not approach the success of Dookie, it still sold two million copies in the United States.Insomniac won the band award nominations for Favorite Artist, Favorite Hard Rock Artist, and Favorite Alternative Artist at the 1996 American Music Awards, and the video for \"Walking Contradiction\" got the band a Grammy nomination for Best Video, Short Form, in addition to a Best Special Effects nomination at the MTV Video Music Awards.[20] After that, the band abruptly cancelled a European tour, citing exhaustion.  Middle era: 1997-2002  After taking a break in 1996, Green Day began to work on a new album in 1997. From the outset, both the band and Cavallo agreed that the album had to be different from its previous records.The result was Nimrod, an experimental deviation from the band's standard pop-punk brand of music. The new album was released in October 1997. It provided a variety of music, from pop-punk, surf rock, and ska, to an acoustic ballad. Nimrod entered the charts at number 10. The success of \"Good Riddance (Time of Your Life)\" won the band an MTV Video Award for Best Alternative Video for the song's video, which depicted people undergoing major changes in their lives while Billie Joe Armstrong strummed his acoustic guitar. The song was also used in the second \"clip show\" episode of Seinfeld and on two episodes of ER. The other singles released from Nimrod were \"Nice Guys Finish Last\", \"Hitchin' a Ride\" and \"Redundant\". The band made a guest appearance in an episode of King of the Hill entitled \"The Man Who Shot Cane Skretteberg\", which aired in 1997.  In 2000, Green Day released Warning, a step further in the style that they had hinted at with Nimrod. Critics' reviews of the album were varied.Allmusic gave it 4.5/5 saying \"Warning may not be an innovative record per se, but it's tremendously satisfying.\" Rolling Stone was more critical, giving it 3/5, and saying \"Warning... invites the question: Who wants to listen to songs of faith, hope and social commentary from what used to be snot-core's biggest-selling band?\" Though it produced the hit \"Minority\" and a smaller hit with \"Warning\", some observers were coming to the conclusion that the band was losing relevance,and a decline in popularity followed. While all of Green Day's past albums had reached a status of at least double platinum, Warning was only certified gold.  At the 2001 California Music Awards, Green Day won all eight awards that they were nominated for. They won the awards for Outstanding Album (Warning), Outstanding Punk Rock/Ska Album (Warning), Outstanding Group, Outstanding Male Vocalist, Outstanding Bassist, Outstanding Drummer, Outstanding Songwriter and Outstanding Artist  The release of a Greatest Hits compilation, International Superhits!, and an assemblage of B-sides, Shenanigans, followed Warning. International Superhits and its companion collection of music videos, International Supervideos!, sold reasonably well, going platinum in the U.S. Shenanigans contained some of the band's b-sides, including \"Espionage\" which was featured in Austin Powers: The Spy Who Shagged Me and was nominated for a Grammy for Best Rock Instrumental Performance.  In the spring of 2002, Green Day co-headlined the Pop Disaster Tour with Blink-182. Despite the co-headlining title, Green Day would play each show before Blink-182, who at the time were experiencing more success. The tour was documented on the DVD Riding In Vans With Boys.  American Idiot and renewed popularity: 2003-2006 Spectators watch Green Day from the grass slopes at the National Bowl.  In the summer of 2003 the band went into a studio to write and record new material for a new album, tentatively titled Cigarettes and Valentines. After completing 20 tracks, the master tapes were stolen from the studio. The band chose not to try to re-create the stolen album, but instead started over. By the end of 2003, Green Day collaborated with Iggy Pop on two tracks for his album Skull Ring. On February 1, 2004 a new song, a cover of \"I Fought the Law\" made its debut on a commercial for iTunes during NFL Super Bowl XXXVIII. The band underwent serious \"band therapy,\" engaging in several long talks to work out the members' differences after accusations from Dirnt and Cool that Armstrong was \"the band's Nazi\" and a show-off bent on taking the limelight from the other band members.  The resulting 2004 album, American Idiot, debuted at number one on the Billboard charts, the band's first ever album to top the chart, backed by the success of the album's first single, \"American Idiot.\" The album was billed as a \"punk rock opera\" which follows the journey of the fictitious \"Jesus of Suburbia\". American Idiot won the 2005 Grammy for \"Best Rock Album\" and the band swept the 2005 MTV music awards, winning a total of seven of the eight awards they were nominated for, including the coveted Viewer's Choice Award.  Through 2005, the band toured in support of the album with about 150 dates -- the longest tour in its career -- visiting Japan, Australia, South America and the United Kingdom, where they drew a crowd of 130,000 people over a span of two days. While touring for American Idiot, they filmed and recorded the two concerts at the Milton Keynes National Bowl in England, which was voted 'The Best Show On Earth' in a Kerrang! Magazine Poll.  These recordings were released as a live CD and DVD called Bullet in a Bible on November 15, 2005. This CD/DVD featured hits from American Idiot as well as a few songs from all its previous albums, except \"Kerplunk\" and \"1,039/Smoothed Out Slappy Hours\". The DVD featured behind-the-scenes footage of the band, and showed how the band prepared to put on the show. The final shows of its 2005 world tour were in Sydney, Australia, and Melbourne, Australia, on December 14 and 17 respectively. On January 10, 2006 the band was awarded with a People's Choice Award for favorite group. Green Day live in Germany during the American Idiot tour.  On August 1, 2005, Green Day announced that that it had rescinded the master rights to its pre-Dookie material from Lookout! Records, citing a continuing breach of contract regarding unpaid royalties, a complaint shared with other Lookout! bands. The pre-Dookie material, which remained out of print for about a year, was reissued by the band's current label, Reprise, on January 9, 2007.  In 2006, Green Day won the Grammy Award for Record of the Year for \"Boulevard of Broken Dreams\" which spent 16 weeks at the number one position of Billboard's Modern Rock Tracks, a record it shared along with Red Hot Chili Peppers' \"Scar Tissue\" and Staind's \"It's Been Awhile,\" (the record has been since been beaten by Foo Fighters' 2007 hit \"The Pretender\" which reigned at the top spot for 18 weeks).  Foxboro Hot Tubs and 21st Century Breakdown: 2007 onward  Green Day engaged in several other smaller projects in the time following the hype of American Idiot. In the spring of 2007, Green Day recorded a cover of the John Lennon song \"Working Class Hero\", which appeared on a compilation album \"Instant Karma\", that benefitted victims in Darfur. In the summer of 2007, Green Day recorded a version of The Simpsons theme song for The Simpsons Movie, as well as having an appearance in the movie.  Green Day recently released a new album under the name Foxboro Hot Tubs entitled Stop Drop and Roll!!!. In an interview with Kerrang!, Billie Joe revealed that 2008 would \"be a fair estimate of the release date of their new untitled eighth studio album.\"In a recent interview with Carson Daly, Garbage lead singer Shirley Manson revealed that Butch Vig would be producing Green Day's forthcoming album. In October 2008 Green Day returned to the studios with Butch Vig, to start recording the new studio album. Two videos showing the band in the studio were posted on YouTube. In the tour section of the band's official website, the message \"World Tour coming soon!\" is shown.In the December 9 issue of Alternative Press, in-depth details about the new album were released. According to the interview, Green Day are recording in the same studio as they did for American Idiot, Ocean Way Recording in Hollywood, California. \"This album is more... religious\", and is influenced by Bob Dylan, Bruce Springsteen, and The Beatles, to name a few.Billie Joe Armstrong said when he was being interviewed for Kerrang!'s readers poll, that it will be more power pop than punk rock.The new album is titled 21st Century Breakdown and was released worldwide on May 15, 2009. Green Day will be going on a world tour starting with North America in July, 2009 until sometime in 2010. Singles from 21st Century Breakdown include Know Your Enemy and 21 Guns.  Musical style and influences  Green Day's sound is often compared to first wave punk bands such as the Ramones, The Clash, Sex Pistols, The Jam, and the Buzzcocks. The majority of their song catalog is composed of distorted guitar, fast, manic drums, and relatively high-treble bass. Most of their songs are fast-paced and under four minutes. Billie Joe Armstrong has mentioned that some of his biggest influences are seminal alternative rock bands H√ºsker D√º and The Replacements, and that their influence is particularly noted in the band's chord changes in songs. In fact, Green Day has covered H√ºsker D√º's \"Don't Want to Know If You Are Lonely\" as a b-side for the \"Warning\" single, and the character \"Mr. Whirly\" in their song \"Misery\" is a reference to the Replacements song of the same name. Among other influences, Green Day have also cited Queen,proto-punks The Who, and power pop pioneers Cheap Trick [46]. Armstrong's lyrics commonly describe alienation, (\"Jesus of Suburbia\", \"Boulevard of Broken Dreams\", \"Road to Acceptance\", \"Disappearing Boy\", \"Castaway\") hysteria (\"Basket Case\", \"Panic Song\"), girls (\"She\", \"80\" \"Only of You\",\"Maria\" \"She's a Rebel\"), growing up (\"Longview\" and \"Welcome to Paradise\"), and the effects of doing drugs (\"Geek Stink Breath\", \"Green Day\"). The Ramones had similar lyrical themes such as hysteria (\"Anxiety\", \"Psycho Therapy\"), alienation (\"Outsider\", \"Something To Believe In\"), girls (\"I Wanna Be Your Boyfriend\", \"Sheena Is a Punk Rocker\"), and drugs (\"Now I Wanna Sniff Some Glue\", \"Chinese Rocks\"). Green Day has covered Ramones songs several times, including recording \"Outsider\" for the tribute album We're a Happy Family, and performing \"Blitzkrieg Bop\" and \"Teenage Lobotomy\" when the Ramones were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2002.  Criticism and controversy  Beginning with the release of Dookie, and the subsequent explosion of MTV airplay it received, Green Day has received considerable criticism from those who see the punk genre as a social movement independent of corporate sponsorship. With the release of American Idiot and the subsequent draw of many new fans, much of this criticism has been revived.  One of the more contentious issues is genre labeling. In reaction to both the style of music and the background of the band, many fans and musicians have taken heavy objection to the usage of the term \"punk\" when applied to Green Day. This is evidenced by the following comments issued by John Lydon (Johnny Rotten), former front man of both the 1970s punk band the Sex Pistols and the 1980s post-punk, Public Image Ltd.: \" So there we are fending off all that and it pisses me off that years later a wank outfit like Green Day hop in and nick all that and attach it to themselves. They didn't earn their wings to do that and if they were true punk they wouldn't look anything like they do. \"  Brandon Flowers of The Killers went on record in 2007 claiming that Green Day's politically driven concept album American Idiot displays \"calculated Anti-Americanism.\" He explained that he has problems with the album content itself and also the fact that the band's recent live DVD, Bullet in a Bible, was filmed in England. The taping of the concert, featured on Bullet in a Bible, shows thousands of Europeans singing along to \"American Idiot.\" Stating that he felt Green Day's DVD is a bit of a stunt, he said, \"I just thought it was really cheap. To go to a place like England or Germany and sing that song - those kids aren't taking it the same way that he meant it. And he (Billie Joe Armstrong) knew it.\"  More recently, Oasis guitarist Noel Gallagher has accused the band of ripping off his song \"Wonderwall\" for \"Boulevard of Broken Dreams\".  Related projects Main article: Green Day related projects  Ever since 1991, some members of the band have branched out past Green Day and have started other projects with other musicians. Notable related projects of Green Day include Billie Joe Armstrong's Pinhead Gunpowder (which also features Green Day's live backup guitarist Jason White), The Frustrators in which Mike Dirnt plays bass, and The Network, in which all three members of Green Day play under fake stage names. Billie Joe Armstrong has also confirmed that the main members of Green Day are in the band Foxboro Hot Tubs. A Foxboro Hot Tubs album titled Stop Drop and Roll!!! was released on 2008-05-20.  Charity projects that the band have been involved with include the collaboration with U2 (\"The Saints Are Coming\") to help raise money for musical instruments lost in Hurricane Katrina, and teaming with the Natural Resources Defense Council for the \"Move America Beyond Oil\" campaign and other environmental concerns.  In September 2006, Green Day teamed up with U2 and producer Rick Rubin to record a cover of the song \"The Saints Are Coming\", originally recorded by The Skids, with an accompanying video. The song is to benefit Music Rising, an organization to help raise money for musicians' instruments lost during Hurricane Katrina, and to bring awareness on the eve of the one year anniversary of the disaster.  \"Working Class Hero\" Play sound \"Working Class Hero\", a cover of a John Lennon song, was released on the Instant Karma CD. Problems listening to this file? See media help.  In December 2006, Green Day and NRDC opened a web site in partnership to raise awareness on America's dependency on oil. (See related projects.)  Green Day released a cover of the John Lennon song \"Working Class Hero\", that was featured on the album Instant Karma: The Amnesty International Campaign to Save Darfur. The band performed the song on the season finale of American Idol. The song was nominated for a Grammy in 2008, but lost to The White Stripes' \"Icky Thump\".  That summer, the band appeared in a cameo role in The Simpsons Movie, where they perform the show's theme song. Their version was released as a single on July 24, 2007.

He is best known as the guitarist and lead vocalist of the rock duo The White Stripes (1997-2011) and more recently guitarist and vocalist of The Raconteurs, and drummer and vocalist for the band The Dead Weather.  Jack White first played as a professional musician in the early 1990s, as a drummer for the Detroit cowpunk band Goober & the Peas. White produced Loretta Lynn's Van Lear Rose in 2004, which won them a Grammy for best country album, and an additional Grammy for best country collaboration for the song Portland Oregon.    The Love Interruption Songfacts reports that his debut solo single, Love Interruption, was made available on January 30, 2012 at White's pay-to-join club Vault and at Jackwhiteiii.com. A week later, it was released on the singer's preferred format, vinyl. It was produced by the ex White Stripe and recorded at his own Third Man Studio in Nashville along with its exclusive non-LP B-side Machine Gun Silhouette. This was followed by his first solo album, Blunderbuss, later in 2012, and an accompanying tour. This is not said to indicate an end to either the Raconteurs or the Dead Weather.  His blaring guitar solos and ability to pull sound from the simplest of \"instruments\" are his greatest strengths along with his desire to partner with female vocalists.  He currently resides in Tennessee. He announced his divorce in 2011 from wife since 2005, fellow musician Karen Elson, and they have two children. Third Man Records (White's label) and Elson's clothing boutique are also located there.  Last.fm Group: http://www.last.fm/group/Blunderbuss",

He was best known as the vocalist, guitarist and pianist of The White Stripes until they split in February 2011, as well as a vocalist and guitarist for The Raconteurs and the drummer of The Dead Weather. White released his debut solo album, Blunderbuss, on April 24, 2012. He is ranked No. 70 on Rolling Stone's list of \"The 100 Greatest Guitarists of All Time\". White's popular and critical success with The White Stripes enabled him to collaborate as a solo artist with other renowned musicians, such as Beck, The Rolling Stones, Jeff Beck,Alicia Keys, Bob Dylan, Electric Six, Insane Clown Posse, and Loretta Lynn, whose 2004 album Van Lear Rose he produced and performed on. In 2006, White became a founding member of the rock band The Raconteurs. In 2009, he became a founding member and drummer of his third commercially successful group, The Dead Weather. He was awarded the title of \"Nashville Music City Ambassador\" by the Nashville mayor Karl Dean in 2011. \n\nEarly life:\nOf Polish, Scottish, and Canadian descent, John Anthony Gillis, the son of Teresa and Gorman Gillis, was born the youngest of ten children (six brothers, three sisters) in a lower middle-class neighborhood in Detroit, Michigan. He grew up in a Catholic family. His father and mother worked for the Archdiocese of Detroit, as the Building Maintenance Superintendent and secretary in the Cardinal's office, respectively. White eventually became an altar boy, which landed him an uncredited role in the 1987 movie The Rosary Murders, filmed mainly at Holy Redeemer parish in southwest Detroit. As a child he was a fan of classical music. He attended Cass Technical High School in Detroit. He began playing an instrument, a drum, at the age of six. As a teenager, White was already listening to the blues and 1960s rock that would influence him in The White Stripes,Son House and Blind Willie McTell being among his favorite blues musicians. He and his childhood friend, Dominic Suchyta (NKA Dominic Davis), would listen to records in White's attic on weekends and began to record cover songs on an old four-track reel to reel tape machine. At the time White was described as \"a kid with short hair and braces\". He has said in many interviews that Son House's \"Grinnin' In Your Face\" is his favorite song of all time. In 2005 on 60 Minutes, White told Mike Wallace that his life could have turned out differently. \"I'd got accepted to a seminary in Wisconsin, and I was gonna become a priest, but at the last second I thought, 'I'll just go to public school. I had just gotten a new amplifier in my bedroom, and I didn't think I was allowed to take it with me.\" At 15, White began a three-year upholstery apprenticeship with a family friend, Brian Muldoon. White credits Muldoon with exposing him to punk music and pushing him to play music with Muldoon as a band: \"He played drums, well I guess I'll play guitar then.\" The two recorded an album, Makers of High Grade Suites, as The Upholsterers. White later started a one-man business of his own, Third Man Upholstery. The slogan of his business was \"Your Furniture's Not Dead\" and the color scheme was yellow and black--including a yellow van, a yellow-and-black uniform, and a yellow clipboard. Although Third Man Upholstery never lacked business, White claims that it was unprofitable, because of his complacency about money and his business practices that were perceived as unprofessional, including making bills out in crayon and writing poetry inside the furniture. Shortly thereafter, White landed his first professional gig, as the drummer for the Detroit band Goober & the Peas. He also played in other local bands and did solo shows. \n\nRecording career:\n\nThe White Stripes:\n\nWhite formed The White Stripes in 1997, along with Meg White, The band began its career as part of the Michigan garage rock underground music scene, playing with local bands such as Bantam Rooster, The Dirtbombs, The Paybacks, Rocket 455, and The Henchmen, among others. In 1998, The White Stripes were signed to Italy Records, a small and independent Detroit-based garage punk label, by Dave Buick. The band released its self-titled debut album in 1999, and a year later the album was followed up by the cult classicDe Stijl. The album eventually peaked at No. 38 in Billboard's Independent Albums chart when the band had established their popularity. While performing and in music videos, Jack and Meg are very recognisable visually, as they dress only in red, white, and black. In 2001 the band released White Blood Cells. The album's stripped-down garage rock sound drew critical acclaim in the UK and soon afterward in the US, making The White Stripes one of the more acclaimed bands of 2002. The album was followed up in 2003 by the commercially and critically successfulElephant. Allmusic wrote that the album \"sounds even more pissed-off, paranoid and stunning than its predecessor ... darker and more difficult than White Blood Cells. \" The album's first single, \"Seven Nation Army\", was the band's most successful. The band's fifth album, Get Behind Me Satan, was recorded in White's own home and marked a change in the band's musical direction, with piano-driven melodies and experimentation with marimba and a more rhythm-based guitar playing by White. The band's sixth album Icky Thump, released in 2007, entered the UK Albums Chart at number one and debuted at number two on the Billboard 200. The album's sound also included more punk, garage and blues influences than its predecessor. In late 2007, the band announced the cancellation of 18 tour dates due to Meg White's acute anxiety problems. White had revealed plans to release a seventh, as of yet untitled album in the summer of 2009. However, this has yet to happen. The band also made their first live appearance since Meg's anxiety problems in September 2007 on the final episode of Late Night with Conan O'Brien on February 20, 2009. A documentary, The White Stripes: Under Great White Northern Lights, about the band's 2007 tour, in which they played a gig in every Canadian province and territory, appeared in the 2009 Toronto International Film Festival. In July 2007, The White Stripes made history by playing the shortest concert ever only playing one note, in St John's, Newfoundland. They played a full show later that night at the Mile One Centre in downtown St. John's. On February 2, 2011, it was reported on the main page of whitestripes.com that the duo has decided to part ways. White stated that it was not due to health issues or artistic differences but there were a \"myriad of reasons\". \n\nThe Raconteurs:\nWhite formed The Raconteurs in 2005 along with Brendan Benson, Jack Lawrence and Patrick Keeler. The origin of the band was the song 'Steady, As She Goes' which White wrote along with Benson. This inspired them to create a full band with the addition of Lawrence and Keeler. The band came together in Detroit during 2005 and, for the remainder of the year, recorded when time allowed. The band's debut album Broken Boy Soldiers was recorded at Benson's home in Detroit. The band set out on tour to support the album, including eight dates as the opening act for Bob Dylan. The group's second album, Consolers of the Lonely, and its first single, \"Salute Your Solution\", simultaneously in 2008. The album received a Grammy nomination. \n\nThe Dead Weather:\n\nIn early 2009, Jack White formed a new group called The Dead Weather with The Kills frontwoman Alison Mosshart. White takes drum and vocal duties, while The Raconteurs bassist Jack Lawrence and Queens of the Stone Age keyboardist and guitarist Dean Fertita round the four piece out. The group debuted a handful of new tracks on March 11, 2009 in Nashville from their debut album Horehound, which came out July 13, 2009 in Europe and July 14, 2009 in North America, on White's Third Man Records label. On October 16, 2009, Mosshart confirmed that the second album was \"halfway done\". The first single \"Die by the Drop\" was released on March 30, 2010. The new album, Sea of Cowards was released on May 7 in Ireland, then on May 11, 2010, in the U.S. and May 10 in the United Kingdom, and again, on White's Third Man Records. \n\nSolo career:\nIt was rumored that in 2003 White collaborated on Electric Six's song \"Danger! High Voltage.\" Both he and the Electric Six denied this, and the vocal work was credited officially to John S O'Leary. However, a recent radio interview with Tim Shaw on Kerrang! 105.2 in the UK had Electric Six lead singer Dick Valentine talking openly about White singing on this song as well as speculating on the amount of money he was paid ($60,000). Also, a Q magazine article stated that Jack White did in fact work with Electric Six on the song \"Gay Bar\". In 2008, White collaborated with Alicia Keys on the song \"Another Way to Die\", the theme song for the James Bond film Quantum of Solace. He performed five songs for the Cold Mountain soundtrack; \"Sittin' on Top of the World\", \"Wayfaring Stranger\", \"Never Far Away\", \"Christmas Time Soon Will Be Over\" and \"Great High Mountain\". In 2009, Jack White was featured in It Might Get Loud, a film in which he, Jimmy Page, and The Edge come together to discuss the electric guitar and each artist's different playing methods. White's first solo single, \"Fly Farm Blues,\" was written and recorded in 10 minutes during the filming of the movie, in August 2009. The single went on sale as a 7-inch vinyl record from Third Man Records and as a digital single available through iTunes on August 11. In November 2010, producer Danger Mouse announced that White has been recruited for his collaboration with Daniele Luppi entitled Rome along with Norah Jones. White provided vocals to three songs on the album: \"The Rose with the Broken Neck,\" \"Two Against One\" and \"The World.\" The song \"You Know That I Know\", finished and performed by White, was featured on The Lost Notebooks of Hank Williams, released on October 4, 2011. On January 30, 2012 White released \"Love Interruption\" as the first single of his debut solo album, Blunderbuss, which was released on April 24, 2012. On March 3, 2012, he appeared on Saturday Night Live as the musical guest, with Lindsay Lohan hosting. He'll be playing selected dates in the summer, with festivals such as Radio 1's Hackney Weekend, Sasquatch! Music Festival, Fuji Rock Festival in Japan, one of the biggest festivals in the world, Rock Werchter in Belgium, and later in the year, he'll be headlining Austin City Limits Music Festival. For his solo shows, White tours with two bands. One, The Peacocks, is all-female, and the other, The Buzzards (sometimes called Los Buzzardos), is all-male. \n\nMusical equipment and sound:\nThe guitars White uses live are two 1965 JB Hutto Montgomery Airlines (one which he received from a fan), a three pickup Airline Town & Country (used on tour with the Raconteurs and in the \"Steady As She Goes\" music video), a Harmony Rocket, a 1970s-era Crestwood Astral II, 1950s-era Kay Hollowbody (given to him by his brother in return for a favor), a Gretsch White Penguin (as seen in the music video for Icky Thump), and a custom Gretsch Rancher Falcon acoustic guitar. When playing with the Raconteurs, White usually plays two custom Gretsch-styled copies of the Duo Jet double-cutaway guitar, which were made in collaboration with his Seattle luthier, Randy Parsons. His main guitar is dubbed the Triple Jet, which is made of copper and features a Gretsch logo from 1912. For their first tour, Jack also played Gretsch Anniversary Jr. with a Bigsby vibrato tailpiece and three Filtertron pickups. He also uses a Gretsch Rancher acoustic guitar and he now uses a custom Gretsch Anniversary Jr. with two cutaways, a built-in retractable microphone, and a theremin next to the Bigsby. Jack has dubbed this one the \"Triple Green Machine\". Also, he plays occasionally with his Gretsch Rancher, a Gibson J-160E. Also, he plays a Gretsch Duo Jet in Cadillac Green. Recently, he has featured his latest Gretsch, a custom white Billy Gibbons/Bo Diddley signature Gretsch Jupiter Thunderbird in the music video for \"Another Way to Die\", this guitar is also used on his concerts with The Dead Weather, but he also uses a black left-handed one since Sea of Cowards came out. He has also been known to play Fender Telecasters, featuring one in the music video for Loretta Lynn's \"Portland, Oregon\". Jack White has also played in live shows, mainly with The Dead Weather, a Daddy Mojo Stove Pipe Cigar Box Guitar. White uses numerous effects to create his live sound, most notably a DigiTech Whammy WH-4 to create the rapid modulations in pitch he uses in his solos. In concert with an MXR Micro Amp and custom Electro-Harmonix Big Muff Distortion/Sustainer, White can produce a very distinctive sound. In 2005, for the single \"Blue Orchid,\" White employed a new Electro-Harmonix creation, the Polyphonic Octave Generator (POG). Similar to (but more versatile than) the Whammy IV, the POG lets the user mix in several octave effects into one along with the dry signal. He also has three Z.Vex Tremolo Probes, that are hand painted black. All of the pedals that he uses live have been professionally painted red to match his red/black/white color scheme (with the exception of his Whammy and the other pedals that are already red). He plugs this setup into a 1970s Fender Twin Reverb and two 100-Watt Sears Silvertone 6x10 combo amplifiers. He also has a Sonic Machine Factory 15 Watt amp in red that can be seen in Under Great White Northern Lights. He uses this as a travel amp for secret or small shows, and also as the amp for his various keyboards when playing for a larger audience. With the Raconteurs, he has many more unusual pedals. And also, for the Raconteurs' 2008 tour, he had all of his pedals copper plated by Analog Man. White also produces a \"fake\" bass tone by playing the Kay Hollowbody and JB Hutto Montgomery Airline guitars through a Whammy IV set to one octave down for a very thick, low, rumbling sound, which he uses most notably on the songs \"Seven Nation Army\" and \"The Hardest Button to Button\" during live performances. On occasion, White also plays other instruments, such as a Black Gibson F-4 mandolin (\"Little Ghost\"), piano (on most tracks from Get Behind Me Satan, and various others), and an electric piano on such tracks as \"The Air Near My Fingers\" and \"I'm Finding it Harder to be a Gentleman\". White also plays percussion instruments such as the marimba (as on \"The Nurse\"), drums and tambourine. For the White Stripes' 2007 tour, he played a custom-finish Hammond A-100 organ with a Leslie 3300 speaker, which was subsequently loaned to Bob Dylan, and currently resides at Third Man Studios. On Broken Boy Soldiers, he is credited as playing the album's synths and organ; however, bandmate Brendan Benson also received credit for these instruments and it is unclear who played on which song. With the Dead Weather, Jack plays a custom Ludwig Classic Maple kit in Black Oyster Pearl. The sizes consist of the following: 16x26 kick, 5x16 snare (primary) 12x14 marching snare (secondary), 7x16 rack tom 14x16 floor tom, two 16x16 floor toms, Paiste 2002 24\"crash, 24\"ride and two 16\" crashes as hi-hats. For the 2009 Full Flash Blank tour, Jack used a drum head with the Three Brides of Dracula on the front, but in 2010, Jack employs a new drum head, upon the release of Sea of Cowards, which has an image of The Third Man himself: Harry Lime attempting to escape certain capture in the sewers of Vienna. During the American leg of the 2010 tour, Jack switched his drum head again featuring a picture of himself in the guise he wore on the cover of Sea of Cowards. This drum head is called Sam Kay by some fans, referring to the insert inside of the 12\" LP. In 2010, Jack White added an acoustic guitar to his collection named Veronica Lake. It is a custom white Gretsch Rancher with a gold double pickguard and a picture of Veronica Lake on the back. He is currently playing it with his band The Dead Weather. It is the newest addition to \"Jack's Girlfriends\" which already include Claudette Colbert that he plays In the Raconteurs, and Rita Hayworth that he plays in the White Stripes. According to Joe Chiccarelli, engineer for Icky Thump, White is not very technical when it comes to capturing his sound on record: \"Usually he wouldn't talk in terms of compression or EQ or any of those things, it was always about what can we do to give something more aggression or hit you in the face more. Jack's brilliance is his understanding of great emotional performances, and of what it takes to make something come alive through the speakers and have an impact.\" \n\nPersonal life:\n\nWhite gives few interviews and reveals few details of his private life. He states that he does not consider it relevant to his art, saying \"It's the same thing as asking Michelangelo, 'What kind of shoes do you wear?'...In the end, it doesn't really matter ... the only thing that's going to be left is our records and photos.\" A topic of intrigue has been the actual relationship between Jack and Meg White. In early interviews, the pair presented themselves as siblings, two of ten. The Flaming Lips touch on this in their song \"Thank You Jack White (for the Fiber-Optic Jesus That You Gave Me)\" released on their 2003 EP Fight Test. However, the Detroit Free Press produced copies of both a marriage license and divorce certificate, confirming Jack and Meg's history as a married couple. Neither addresses the truth officially and over time, they have become less verbal about the origins of their relationship. Jack White has said, though, that siblings are \"mated for life\", thus such relationships distract less from the music. Jack mentions them being brother and sister in the documentary Under Great White Northern Lights. In the early 1990s, Meg White worked as a bartender at Memphis Smoke, a bar in downtown Royal Oak (a Detroit suburb), where she first met Jack, then still known under his original surname 'Gillis'. They were married on September 21, 1996 and were divorced on March 24, 2000. Jack took her last name. White is often referred to as eccentric. For instance, he has an obsession with the number three. On November 7, 2005, it was widely reported that White had changed his name to \"Three Quid\" (quid is British slang for pound sterling). However, most reports indicated that this would only last until the end of the tour. On December 13, 2003, White was involved in an altercation with Jason Stollsteimer, lead singer of The Von Bondies, at the Magic Stick, a Detroit club. White was charged with misdemeanor aggravated assault. He pleaded guilty to the lesser charge of assault and battery, and was fined $750 (including court costs), and was sentenced to take anger management classes. In 2003, White made his acting debut in Mutant Swinger from Mars, and had a brief but highly publicized romantic relationship with actress Ren√©e Zellweger, whom he met during the filming of Cold Mountain. That summer, the couple were in a car accident in which White broke his left index finger and was forced to reschedule much of the summer tour. He posted the footage of his finger surgery on the web for fans. White and Zellweger's breakup became public in December 2004. White met British model Karen Elson (twin sister of Kate Elson) when she appeared in The White Stripes music video for \"Blue Orchid\". The video's director, Floria Sigismondi, noted \"you sensed an energy between them\". They married on June 1, 2005 in Manaus, Brazil. The wedding took place in a canoe on the Amazon River and was officiated by a shaman. A Roman Catholic priest later convalidated their marriage. Manager Ian Montone was the best man and Meg White was the maid of honor. Official wedding announcements stated that \"it was the first marriage\" for both. On May 2, 2006, the couple had a daughter, Scarlett Teresa White. Their second child, Henry Lee White, was born on August 7, 2007. The White family resides in Brentwood, Tennessee, a suburb south of Nashville, where Elson managed a vintage clothing store called Venus & Mars. The couple announced their divorce in June 2011, throwing a divorce party to celebrate their sixth anniversary and the \"making and breaking of the sacred union of marriage,\" according to the invitation sent to guests. In a press statement, the couple vowed to remain \"dear and trusted friends and co-parents.\" It is rumored that Karen Elson is \"Mildred\" of the Third Man Records produced album, \"Mildred and The Mice\". In 2006, it was revealed in the Sunday Times Rich List that White and his British wife Elson had a joint fortune of at least ¬£20 million (US$37 million). This ranked them at seventh place in the list of entertainers under age 30 who were born or live in the United Kingdom, ahead of the likes of Orlando Bloom and Kate Winslet. \n\nTV appearances:\nOn January 9, 2012, Jack White appeared on American Pickers.

Raised in Northeast Los Angeles and in Northern California, Moore joined the American post-hardcore band From First to Last as the lead singer in 2004, and recorded two studio albums with the band (Dear Diary, My Teen Angst Has a Body Count, 2004, and Heroine, 2006) before leaving to pursue a solo career in 2007. He began his first tour as a solo artist in late 2007. After recruiting a new band lineup, Moore joined the Alternative Press Tour to support bands such as All Time Low and The Rocket Summer, and appeared on the cover of Alternative Press' annual \"100 Bands You Need to Know\" issue. After releasing the Gypsyhook EP in 2009, Moore was scheduled to record his debut studio album, Bells, with producer Noah Shain. However, he ceased production of the album and began performing under the name Skrillex. After releasing the My Name is Skrillex EP for free download on his official MySpace page, he released the Scary Monsters and Nice Sprites EP in late-2010 and More Monsters and Sprites EP in mid-2011. Both have since become moderate commercial successes. On November 30, 2011, he was nominated for a total of five Grammy Awards at the 54th Grammy Awards, including Best New Artist and won three: \"Best Dance/Electronica Album,\" \"Best Dance Recording,\" and \"Best Remixed Recording, Non-Classical\". On December 5, 2011, the BBC announced that he had been nominated for their Sound of 2012 poll. On December 12, 2011, he was also named MTV's Electronic Dance Music Artist of the Year. \n\nBiography:\n\nBackground:\nMoore was born in the Highland Park neighborhood of Northeast Los Angeles, but moved to the Forest Hill neighborhood of San Francisco at the age of two, where he attended elementary school. At the ages of nine and ten, Moore attended a local boarding school located in the Mojave Desert LV, but eventually moved back to Northern California. By the age of twelve, his family moved him back to his birthplace of Northeast L.A., where he enrolled in a private academy school specializing in arts, and was then later home schooled at the age of fourteen due to bullying. In 2004, he learned he was adopted and dropped out of the program when he was sixteen years old. While a young teenager in Los Angeles, Moore would attend punk gigs in Mexican American neighborhoods in East and South Los Angeles, and later on electro club raves in the downtown's Silver Lake and Echo Park neighborhoods. \n\nFrom First to Last (2004-07):\nIn 2004, Moore contacted Matt Good of From First to Last about playing guitar for the band on their debut album. After flying out to Georgia, Moore was heard singing by three studio producers, Derrick Thomas, Eric Dale, and McHale Butler, and was then made lead singer, with Good playing guitar. In June 2004, Epitaph Records released the band's first full-length record with their new bandmate, Dear Diary, My Teen Angst Has a Body Count. After performing on several successful tours, two being the Vans Warped Tour and Dead by Dawn tour, they began recording their second album, Heroine with producer Ross Robinson. The album was released in March 2006 on Epitaph. With high record sales once again, the band found themselves part of many successful tours, until Moore started suffering vocal problems, causing the band to resign from several tours. After going through a successful vocal surgical procedure, Moore informed the band he would be permanently resigning to work on a solo career. FFTL's last show performed with Moore was in their hometown of Orlando at The House of Blues while touring with Atreyu. \n\nSolo career (2007-present):\n\nMoore announced he had left From First to Last to pursue a solo career. He then launched a Myspace page displaying three demos (\"Signal\", \"Equinox\", and \"Glow Worm\"). This led to Moore's first performance since his leaving From First to Last. On April 7, 2007, alongside harpist Carol Robbins, Moore played several original songs at a local art building. After months of releasing demos via Myspace, Moore played on the Team Sleep Tour with a full band. The tour also featured supporting acts Monster in the Machine and Strata. Moore made several demo CDs available on this tour, limited to about 30 per show. These CDs were tour exclusive, and were packaged in \"baby blue envelopes\", each with a unique drawing by Moore or bandmate. In February 2008, Alternative Press Magazine announced the second annual AP Tour, with All Time Low, The Rocket Summer, The Matches, and Forever the Sickest Kids, as well as Sonny Moore. The tour started in Houston, Texas on March 14 and went through North America, ending in Cleveland, Ohio on May 2, with the majority of the shows being sold out. All bands playing the tour would be featured on the cover of Alternative Press Magazine's annual 100 Bands You Need to Know special, and would be interviewed on the Alternative Press Podcast. During this tour Moore's line-up consisted of Sean Friday on drums, Christopher Null on guitar, and Aaron Rothe on keyboards. On April 7, 2009, he released Gypsyhook EP, a digital EP, which featured three songs and four remixes. Also included was a Japanese version of \"Mora\" entitled \"Êµ∑Ê∞¥\" (\"Kaisui\"). Physical copies of the EP were available at his shows. After going on tour with Innerpartysystem and Paper Route and opening for Chiodos on their European tour, Moore performed at Bamboozle on May 2. He performed on Bamboozle Left's Saints and Sinners stage on April 4. He toured with Hollywood Undead in April 2009 performing under the band name Sonny and the Blood Monkeys, with Chris Null (electric guitar), Sean Friday (drums, percussion & beats) and Aaron Rothe (keyboards, synthesizers, programming & turntables) Although no official statement has been given regarding the album, Moore has stated that Bells will no longer be released. \n\nProduction career:\n\nIn 2008, Moore began producing and performing under the alias Skrillex at clubs in the Los Angeles area. Previously, he had been known on the Internet as Twipz. On June 7, 2010, Moore released his official Skrillex debut EP, My Name is Skrillex as a free download. Moore provided programming and vocals for UK metalcore band Bring Me the Horizon on their third studio album, There Is a Hell, Believe Me I've Seen It. There Is a Heaven, Let's Keep It a Secret. Later in the year, Sonny began a nationwide tour with Deadmau5 after being signed to mau5trap recordings and released his second EP, Scary Monsters and Nice Sprites. Moore kicked off the \"Project Blue Book Tour\" in 2011 with support from Porter Robinson, Tommy Lee and DJ Aero as well as appearances from Sofia Toufa for a new song titled \"Bring out the Devil.\" Skrillex unveiled several new songs on this tour including \"First Of The Year\" (formerly known as \"Equinox\"), \"Reptile\", and \"Cinema\" (remix of a Benny Benassi track). \"Reptile\" was featured in the TV commercial for Mortal Kombat 9, and \"First of the Year (Equinox)\" is featured on his follow up EP and remix companion to Scary Monsters and Nice Sprites, titled More Monsters and Sprites. In April 2011, Spin magazine premiered \"Get Up\", an exclusive new track from Korn that was produced by Skrillex. Korn made \"Get Up\" available for free download via their Facebook page. On April 15, 2011 KoRn joined Skrillex on stage for his set at Coachella 2011. On April 18, 2011, Sony Computer Entertainment (SCEA) development studio Naughty Dog released a trailer for the multiplayer component of their PlayStation 3 game Uncharted 3: Drake's Deception, featuring \"Kill EVERYBODY\" from Scary Monsters and Nice Sprites. In June 2011, \"More Monsters and Sprites\" was released on Beatport, an EP consisting of three original tracks, including \"First of the Year (Equinox)\" and two versions of his original track \"Ruffneck\". A leaked track entitled \"Ruffneck Bass\" had been leaked on the internet months prior which used the same sample as in the new \"Ruffneck\" tracks on the EP. Skrillex released a music video for \"Rock n' Roll (Will Take You to the Mountain)\" on his official YouTube page on June 20, 2011. \n\nOn August 17, 2011 Skrillex announced his label, OWSLA. \"The label's first releases will come from Bristol-based dubstep producer Koan Sound, electro-house newcomer Porter Robinson from North Carolina, singer/songwriter Alvin Risk, and San Francisco-based M Machine (formally Metropolis).\" Skrillex released a music video for \"First of the Year (Equinox)\" via Spin.com on August 19, 2011. In late August 2011 it was released that he would be appearing Knife Party's first release, collaborating on a Moombahton style track entitled \"Zoology\". A preview was released on YouTube. In late September 2011 he created the track \"Syndicate\" as promotion for the video game of the same name. Kaskade's 2011 album Fire & Ice features a collaboration between Kaskade and Skrillex entitled \"Lick It\". The video for Skrillex's song \"First of the Year (Equinox)\" appears on the first episode of the Beavis and Butt-head revival. On November 8, Skrillex stated that he intended to release an album entitled Voltage. Skrillex gave fans more info about Voltage in RockSound Magazine after a photoshoot for the cover and doing an extensive interview on his tour. For unknown reasons, however, the album was never released. On December 21, 2011, Skrillex unveiled the Bangarang EP for a Beatport release on December 23. On March 13, 2012, Beatport released OWSLA's second Free Treats sampler, Free Treats Vol. 2. The 19-track compilation features \"Ruffneck (FULL Flex) Munchi Anonymous Revolution Remix\", a remixed track by Skrillex. This new take on the track deviates from the original (released on the More Monsters and Sprites EP), with the remix being more characteristic of Electro House, though with a much slower tempo of 108 BPM, versus the original version's classic Dubstep tempo of 140 BPM, also straying from the typical Electro House tempo of 128 BPM. On August 12, 2012, his new side-project formed with Boys Noize called Dog Blood released an EP called Next Order/Middle Finger. \n\nInfluences:\nMoore has stated in an online interview that he has been a longtime fan of Warp, an electronic music label that has released recordings from artists such as Aphex Twin and Squarepusher. \n\nPersonal life:\nAs of February 2012, Skrillex has been dating fellow artist and singer, Ellie Goulding, who provided vocals for the Skrillex track, \"Summit\", featured on the EP, Bangarang.",

The band consists of lead vocalist and guitarist Billie Joe Armstrong, bassist and backing vocalist Mike Dirnt, and drummer Tre Cool. Cool replaced former drummer John Kiffmeyer in 1990, prior to the recording of the band's second studio album, Kerplunk (1992). Green Day was originally part of the punk scene at 924 Gilman Street in Berkeley, California. The band's early releases were from the independent record label Lookout! Records. In 1994, its major label debut Dookie released through Reprise Records became a breakout success and eventually sold over 10 million copies in the U.S. Green Day was widely credited, alongside fellow California punk bands Sublime,The Offspring and Rancid, with popularizing and reviving mainstream interest in punk rock in the United States. Green Day's three follow-up albums, Insomniac (1995), Nimrod (1997), and Warning (2000) did not achieve the massive success of Dookie, though they were still successful, with Insomniac and Nimrod reaching double platinum and Warning reaching gold status. The band's rock opera, American Idiot (2004), reignited the band's popularity with a younger generation, selling five million copies in the United States. The band's eighth studio album, 21st Century Breakdown, was released in 2009 which achieved the band's best chart performance to date. The band will begin to release a trilogy of albums called ¬°Uno!, ¬°Dos!, and ¬°Tr√©!, to be released September 25, 2012, November 13, 2012, and January 15, 2013 respectively. Green Day has sold over 65 million records worldwide with 25 million in the US alone. The group has won five Grammy Awards: Best Alternative Album for Dookie, Best Rock Album for American Idiot, Record of the Year for \"Boulevard of Broken Dreams\", Best Rock Album for the second time for 21st Century Breakdown and Best Musical Show Album for American Idiot: The Original Broadway Cast Recording. In 2010, a stage adaptation of American Idiot debuted on Broadway. The musical was nominated for several Tony Awards, including Best Musical and Best Scenic Design. \n\nHistory:\n\nFormation and Lookout! years (1987-1993):\nIn 1987, friends Billie Joe Armstrong and Mike Dirnt, 15 years old at the time, formed a band called Sweet Children. Its first live performance took place on October 17, 1987 at Rod's Hickory Pit in Vallejo, California. In 1988, Armstrong and Dirnt began working with Sean Hughes and the former Isocracy drummer John Kiffmeyer, also known as \"Al Sobrante\". As said in the film Punk's Not Dead, Armstrong cites the band Operation Ivy (which featured Tim Armstrong and Matt Freeman of Rancid) as a major influence, and a group that inspired him to form a band. In 1988, Larry Livermore, owner of Lookout! Records, saw the band play an early show and signed the group to his label. In 1989, the band recorded its debut extended play, 1,000 Hours. Before 1,000 Hours was released, the group dropped the name Sweet Children; according to Livermore, this was done to avoid confusion with another local band Sweet Baby. The band adopted the name Green Day, due to their fondness for marijuana. Lookout! would release Green Day's debut studio album, 39/Smooth in early 1990. Green Day would record two extended plays later that year, Slappy and Sweet Children, the latter of which included older songs that the band had recorded for the Minneapolis independent record label Skene! Records. In 1991, Lookout! Records re-released 39/Smooth under the name 1,039/Smoothed Out Slappy Hours, and added the songs from the band's first two EPs, Slappy, and 1,000 Hours. In late 1990, shortly after the band's first nationwide tour, Sobrante left the East Bay area to attend college.The Lookouts drummer Tre Cool began filling in as a temporary replacement and later Cool's position as Green Day's drummer became permanent. The band went on tour for most of 1992 and 1993, and played a number of shows overseas in Europe. The band's second studio album Kerplunk sold 50,000 copies in the U.S. \n\nBreakthrough success (1994-1996):\n\nKerplunk's underground success led to a number of major record labels being interested in signing Green Day, and the band eventually left Lookout! and signed to Reprise Records after attracting the attention of producer Rob Cavallo. The group was impressed by his work with fellow Californian band The Muffs, and later remarked that Cavallo \"was the only person we could really talk to and connect with\". Reflecting on the period, Armstrong told Spin magazine in 1999, \"I couldn't go back to the punk scene, whether we were the biggest success in the world or the biggest failure ... The only thing I could do was get on my bike and go forward.\" After signing with Reprise, the band went to work on recording its major label debut, Dookie. Recorded in three weeks, and released in February 1994,Dookie became a commercial success, helped by extensive MTV airplay for the videos of the songs \"Longview\", \"Basket Case\", and \"When I Come Around\", all of which reached the number one position on the Modern Rock Tracks charts. That year, Green Day embarked on a nationwide tour with queercore band Pansy Division as its opening act. At a September 9, 1994 performance at Hatch Memorial Shell in Boston, mayhem broke-out during the band's set (cut short to seven songs) and by the end of the rampage, 100 people were injured and 45 arrested. The band also joined the lineups of both the Lollapalooza festival and Woodstock '94, where they started an infamous mud fight. During the concert, a security guard mistook bassist Mike Dirnt for a stage-invading fan and punched out some of his teeth. Viewed by millions by pay-per-view television, the Woodstock 1994 performance further aided Green Day's growing publicity and recognition, and helped push its album to eventual diamond status. In 1995, Dookie won the Grammy Award for Best Alternative Album and the band was nominated for nine MTV Video Music Awards including Video of the Year. In 1995, a new single for the Angus soundtrack was released, entitled \"J.A.R.\". The single debuted at number one on the Billboard Modern Rock Tracks chart. The song was followed by the band's fourth studio album, Insomniac, which was released in the fall of 1995. Insomniac was a much darker and heavier response to the band's newfound popularity, compared to the more melodic Dookie. The album opened to a warm critical reception, earning 4 out of 5 stars from Rolling Stone, which said \"In punk, the good stuff actually unfolds and gains meaning as you listen without sacrificing any of its electric, haywire immediacy. And Green Day are as good as this stuff gets.\" The singles released from Insomniac were \"Geek Stink Breath\", \"Stuck with Me\", \"Brain Stew/Jaded\", and \"Walking Contradiction\". Though the album did not approach the success of Dookie, it sold two million copies in the United States. In addition, the album won the band award nominations for Favorite Artist, Favorite Hard Rock Artist, and Favorite Alternative Artist at the 1996 American Music Awards, and the video for \"Walking Contradiction\" got the band a Grammy nomination for Best Video, Short Form, in addition to a Best Special Effects nomination at the MTV Video Music Awards. After that, the band abruptly cancelled a European tour, citing exhaustion. \n\nMiddle years and decline in commercial success (1997-2002):\nAfter a brief hiatus in 1996, Green Day began to work on a new album in 1997. From the outset, both the band and Cavallo agreed that the album had to be different from its previous albums. The result was Nimrod, an experimental deviation from the band's standard pop-punk brand of music. The new album was released in October 1997. It provided a variety of music, from pop-punk, surf rock, and ska, to an acoustic ballad. Nimrod entered the charts at number 10. The success of \"Good Riddance (Time of Your Life)\" won the band an MTV Video Award for Best Alternative Video. The song was also used in the second \"clip show\" episode of Seinfeld and on two episodes of ER. The other singles released from Nimrod were \"Nice Guys Finish Last\", \"Hitchin' a Ride\" and \"Redundant\". The band made a guest appearance in an episode of King of the Hill entitled \"The Man Who Shot Cane Skretteberg\", which aired in 1997. In late 1997 and most of 1998, Green Day embarked on a tour in support of Nimrod. In 2000, Green Day released its sixth studio album Warning. In support of the album, the band participated in the Warped Tour in 2000. The band also had an independent tour to support the album in 2001. Critics' reviews of the album were varied.Allmusic gave it 4.5/5 saying \"Warning may not be an innovative record per se, but it's tremendously satisfying.\"Rolling Stone was more critical, giving it 3/5, and saying \"Warning... invites the question: Who wants to listen to songs of faith, hope and social commentary from what used to be snot-core's biggest-selling band?\" Though it produced the hit \"Minority\" and a smaller hit with \"Warning\", some observers were coming to the conclusion that the band was losing relevance, and a decline in popularity followed. While all of Green Day's previous albums had reached a status of at least double platinum, Warning was only certified gold. At the 2001 California Music Awards, Green Day won all eight of the awards that it was nominated for. The group won the awards for Outstanding Album (Warning), Outstanding Punk Rock/Ska Album (Warning), Outstanding Group, Outstanding Male Vocalist, Outstanding Bassist, Outstanding Drummer, Outstanding Songwriter, and Outstanding Artist. The release of two compilation albums, International Superhits! and Shenanigans, followed Warning. International Superhits and its companion collection of music videos, International Supervideos!. Shenanigans contained some of the band's b-sides, including \"Espionage\", which was featured in the film Austin Powers: The Spy Who Shagged Me and was nominated for a Grammy Award for Best Rock Instrumental Performance. In the spring of 2002, Green Day co-headlined the Pop Disaster Tour with Blink-182 which was documented on the DVD Riding in Vans with Boys. \n\nAmerican Idiot and renewed success (2003-2006):\n\nIn the summer of 2003, the band went into a studio to write and record new material for a new album, tentatively titled Cigarettes and Valentines. After completing 20 tracks, the master recordings were stolen from the studio. Instead of re-recording the stolen tracks, the band decided to abandon the entire project and start over, considering the material to be unrepresentative of the band's best work. It was then revealed that a band called The Network was signed to Armstrong's record label Adeline Records with little fanfare and information. After the mysterious band released an album called Money Money 2020, it was rumored that The Network was a Green Day side project, due to the similarities in the bands' sounds. However, these rumors were never addressed by the band or Adeline Records, except for a statement on the Adeline website discussing an ongoing dispute between the two bands. Green Day collaborated with Iggy Pop on two tracks for his album Skull Ring in November 2003. On February 1, 2004 a new song, a cover of \"I Fought the Law\" made its debut on a commercial for iTunes during NFL Super Bowl XXXVIII. \n\nThe resulting album, American Idiot (2004), debuted at number one on the Billboard charts, the band's first album to reach number one, backed by the success of the album's first single, American Idiot. The album was labeled as a punk rock opera which follows the journey of the fictitious Jesus of Suburbia.American Idiot won the 2005 Grammy for Best Rock Album. The band also won a total of seven awards out of eight awards for which they were nominated, including the Viewer's Choice Award in MTV Video Music Awards 2005. Through 2005, the band toured in support of the album with nearly 150 dates (Longest tour in their career) visiting Japan, Australia, South America and the United Kingdom. While touring for American Idiot, they filmed and recorded the two concerts at the Milton Keynes National Bowl in England, which was voted 'The Best Show On Earth' in a Kerrang! Magazine Poll. These recordings were released as a live CD and DVD called Bullet in a Bible on November 15, 2005. This CD/DVD featured songs from American Idiot as well as songs from all its previous albums, except Kerplunk and 1,039/Smoothed Out Slappy Hours. The DVD featured behind-the-scenes footage of the band, and showed how the band prepared to put on the show. The final shows of its 2005 world tour were in Sydney and Melbourne in Australia, on December 14 and 17 respectively. On August 1, 2005, Green Day announced that it had rescinded the master rights to its pre-Dookie material from Lookout! Records, citing a continuing breach of contract regarding unpaid royalties, a complaint shared with other Lookout! bands. On January 10, 2006 the band was awarded with a People's Choice Award as favorite musical group or band. \n\n21st Century Breakdown and American Idiot: The Musical (2006-2010):\nGreen Day engaged in a number of other smaller projects in the time following the success of American Idiot. The group released an album under the name Foxboro Hot Tubs entitled Stop Drop and Roll!!!. In 2008, the Foxboro Hot Tubs went on a mini-tour to promote the record, hitting tiny Bay Area venues including the Stork Club in Oakland and Toot's Tavern in Crockett, CA. \n\nIn an interview with Carson Daly, Garbage lead singer Shirley Manson revealed that Butch Vig would be producing Green Day's forthcoming album. The span of nearly five years between American Idiot and 21st Century Breakdown was the longest gap between studio albums in Green Day's career. The band had been working on new material since January 2006. By October 2007, Armstrong had 45 songs written, but the band showed no further signs of progress until October 2008, when two videos showing the band recording in the studio with producer Butch Vig were posted on YouTube. The writing and recording process, spanning three years and four recording studios, was finally finished in April 2009. 21st Century Breakdown, was released on May 15, 2009. The album received a mainly positive reception from critics, getting an average rating between 3 and 4 stars. After the release, the album reached number one in fourteen countries, being certified gold or platinum in each. 21st Century Breakdown achieved Green Day's best chart performance to date. The band started playing shows in California in April and early May. It was their first live show in about three years. Green Day went on a world tour that started in North America in July 2009 and continuing around the world throughout the rest of 2009 and early 2010.Wal-Mart refused to carry the album as it contains a Parental Advisory sticker and requested that Green Day release a censored edition. The band members did not wish to change any lyrics on the album and responded by stating, \"There's nothing dirty about our record... They want artists to censor their records in order to be carried in there. We just said no. We've never done it before. You feel like you're in 1953 or something.\" In 2009, the band met with award-winning director Michael Mayer and many cast and crew members of the Tony Award-winning musical Spring Awakening to create a stage version of the album American Idiot.American Idiot: The Musical opened in the Berkeley Repertory Theatre during the end of 2009. The show features an expanded story of the original album, with new characters such as Will, Extraordinary Girl, and Favorite Son. On April 20, 2010, American Idiot: The Musical opened on Broadway, and Green Day released the soundtrack to the musical, featuring a new song by Green Day entitled \"When It's Time\". In June 2010 the iTunes received the single \"When It's Time\". During the Spike TV Video Game Awards 2009, it was announced that Green Day was set to have its own Rock Band video game titled as Green Day: Rock Band, as a follow-up to the last band specific Rock Band game, The Beatles: Rock Band. The game features the full albums of Dookie, American Idiot, and 21st Century Breakdown as well as select songs from the rest of Green Day's discography. During the second leg of the 21st Century Breakdown World Tour the band had said that they are writing new material. In an interview with Kerrang! magazine, Armstrong spoke about the possible new album: \"We did some demos in Berlin, some in Stockholm, some just outside of Glasgow and some in Amsterdam. We wanted get the songs down in some early form.\" The band also stated that they were recording a live album during the entire tour on the last date of the tour in Mountain View, California, also before playing the song \"Cigarettes and Valentines\". In October 2010, Dirnt was interviewed by Radio W, mentioning that they have completed the writing process of the ninth studio album. In the interview, Dirnt also mentioned that a new live album will \"most likely\" be released. The live CD/DVD and CD/Blu-ray entitled Awesome as Fuck was released on March 22, 2011. \n\n¬°Uno!, ¬°Dos!, and ¬°Tr√©! (2011-present):\nOn August 11, 2011, Green Day played a secret show in Costa Mesa, California, and performed an entire set of over 15 new songs allegedly for a possible upcoming album. Green Day put a news post on their official website which read \"Thanks everyone for coming out to the show...\" and \"Stay tuned for more\". It also included lyrics to a new song that was played at the show called \"Amy\" which is dedicated to Amy Winehouse, who died weeks before the show. In February 2012, Armstrong announced through Twitter that the band were in the studio, recording material for a new album. On February 24, 2012, the band began uploading behind the scenes videos of the recording of the new album to YouTube. On April 11, singer Billie Joe Armstrong announced that Green Day would be releasing a trilogy of albums called ¬°Uno!, ¬°Dos!, and ¬°Tr√©!. Armstrong stated that they would be released on September 25, 2012, November 13, 2012, and January 15, 2013 respectively. On June 14, 2012, Green Day released the official artwork of the album ¬°Uno! on YouTube and Facebook. Armstrong in a talk with Rolling Stone Magazine confirmed that each album will have a member of the band on its cover. The ¬°Uno! ¬°Dos! ¬°Tr√©! Ultimate Box Set has also been announced by Warner Bros. Records and will contain all three albums, as well as various other content, such as three digital singles and a one year online membership or renewal to the Idiot Club. The band played at the Rock En Seine festival in France on August 24-26, 2012, the Rock am See festival in Germany on September 1, 2012 and the Reading festival in the UK. The band has also announced a US tour supporting the trilogy, from November 2012 through February 2013. ¬°Uno! was released on September 24, 2012 and has been met with generally favorable reviews. \n\nMusical style and influences:\n\nGreen Day's sound is often compared to first wave punk bands such as the Ramones, The Clash, Sex Pistols, and the Buzzcocks. Citing the band's musical style prevalent on Dookie, Stephen Erlewine of Allmusic described Green Day as \"punk revivalists who recharged the energy of speedy, catchy three-chord punk-pop songs.\" While Armstrong is the primary songwriter, he looks to the other band members for organizational help. Billie Joe Armstrong has mentioned that some of his biggest influences are seminal alternative rock bands H√ºsker D√º and The Replacements, and that their influence is particularly noted in the band's chord changes in songs. Green Day has covered H√ºsker D√º's \"Don't Want to Know If You Are Lonely\" as a b-side to the \"Warning\" single, and the character \"Mr. Whirly\" in their song \"Misery\" is a reference to the Replacements song of the same name. Among other influences, Green Day have also cited The Who and power pop pioneers Cheap Trick. The band has generated controversy over whether the band's musical style and major-label status constitutes as \"true punk\". In reaction to both the style of music and the background of the band, John Lydon, former front man of the 1970s punk band the Sex Pistols commented: \n\"So there we are fending off all that and it pisses me off that years later a wank outfit like Green Day hop in and nick all that and attach it to themselves. They didn't earn their wings to do that and if they were true punk they wouldn't look anything like they do.\" \nArmstrong himself has discussed the group's status of being a punk band on a major record label, saying \"Sometimes I think we've become totally redundant because we're this big band now, we've made a lot of money - we're not punk rock any more. But then I think about it and just say, 'You can take us out of a punk rock environment, but you can't take the punk rock out of us.'\" English rock musician Noel Gallagher of Oasis also complained about the band semi-jokingly, claiming that they ripped off his song \"Wonderwall\" with their song \"Boulevard of Broken Dreams\". \n\nRelated projects:\nSince 1991, members of the band have branched out past Green Day and have started other projects with other musicians. Notable related projects of Green Day include Billie Joe Armstrong's Pinhead Gunpowder (which also features Green Day's live back-up guitarist Jason White), The Frustrators in which Mike Dirnt plays bass, and The Network, a collaboration between Green Day and members of the band, Devo in which all members play under fake stage names. Green Day has also released an album titled Stop Drop and Roll!!! on May 20, 2008, under the name Foxboro Hot Tubs, they currently use this name to book secret shows. In late December 2011, Armstrong formed a new side band called The Boo along his wife Adrienne and their two sons. In September 2006, Green Day collaborated with U2 and producer Rick Rubin to record a cover of the song \"The Saints Are Coming\", originally recorded by The Skids, with an accompanying video. The song was recorded to benefit Music Rising, an organization to help raise money for musicians' instruments lost during Hurricane Katrina, and to bring awareness on the eve of the one year anniversary of the disaster. In December 2006, Green Day and NRDC opened a web site in partnership to raise awareness on America's dependency on oil. Green Day released a cover of the John Lennon song \"Working Class Hero\", which was featured on the album Instant Karma: The Amnesty International Campaign to Save Darfur. The band performed the song on the season finale of American Idol. The song was nominated for a Grammy Award in 2008, though lost to The White Stripes' \"Icky Thump\". That summer, the band appeared in a cameo role in The Simpsons Movie, where they perform the show's theme song. Their version was released as a single on July 24, 2007. In 2009, the band collaborated with theatre director Michael Mayer to adapt their rock opera American Idiot into a one-act stage musical that premiered at the Berkeley Rep on September 15, 2009. The show then moved to Broadway on April 20, 2010. The reviews of American Idiot: The Musical have been positive to mixed. Charles Isherwood of The New York Times wrote an enthusiastic review for the Broadway production. He called the show \"a pulsating portrait of wasted youth that invokes all the standard genre conventions ... only to transcend them through the power of its music and the artistry of its execution, the show is as invigorating and ultimately as moving as anything I've seen on Broadway this season. Or maybe for a few seasons past.\" Jed Gottlieb of the Boston Herald enjoyed the premise of the show but found that \"the music and message suffer in a setting where the audience is politely, soberly seated\". Michael Kuchiwara of the Associated Press found the show to be \"visually striking and musically adventurous\", but noted that \"the show has the barest wisp of a story and minimal character development\". Paul Kolnik in USA Today enjoyed the contradiction that Green Day's \"massively popular, starkly disenchanted album ... would be the feel-good musical of the season\". Time magazine's Richard Zoglin opined that the score \"is as pure a specimen of contemporary punk rock as Broadway has yet encountered yet there's enough variety. ... Where the show fall short is as a fully developed narrative.\" He concluded that \"American Idiot, despite its earnest huffing and puffing, remains little more than an annotated rock concert. ... Still, it deserves at least two cheers - for its irresistible musical energy and for opening fresh vistas for that odd couple, rock and Broadway.\" Peter Travers from Rolling Stone, in his review of American Idiot, wrote \"Though American Idiot carries echoes of such rock musicals as Tommy, Hair, Rent and Spring Awakening, it cuts its own path to the heart. You won't know what hit you. American Idiot knows no limits--it's a global knockout.\" The musical has been nominated for a number of Tony Awards, including Best Musical and Best Scenic Design. It was also nominated for a number of Drama Desk Awards and Outer Critics Circle Awards. In October 2009, a Green Day art project was exhibited at StolenSpace Gallery in London. The exhibition showed artworks created for each of the songs on 21st Century Breakdown, was supported by the band, and led by their manager Pat Magnarella. He explained in an interview that \"Artists are basically like rock bands. Most are creating their art, but don't know how to promote it.\" For Billie Joe Armstrong, \"Many of the artists... show their work on the street, and we feel a strong connection to that type of creative expression.\" On April 13, 2011, a film version of American Idiot was confirmed. Michael Mayer, director of the Broadway musical, will be directing the film. It will be produced by Green Day, Pat Magnarella (Green Day's manager who also produced Bullet in a Bible, Awesome as Fuck, and Heart Like a Hand Grenade), Playtone (Tom Hanks and Gary Goetzman) and Tom Hulce. \n\nInvolvement in politics and social justice:\nWhen asked his opinion regarding whether all musicians ought to try to add a social or political message to their work, Armstrong replied that \" \nThe only people who should sing about social issues or politics are the ones who aren't full of shit. \n\" \n American Idiot was released two months before former President of the United States George W. Bush was reelected, and as a result the album became protest art. Created as an anti-war album, American Idiot contains many new-age protest songs, like Holiday which was against George Bush's decision to invade Iraq. Armstrong described the song as a means by which \"to battle your way out of your own ignorance\". \n\nBand members:\n\nCurrent members \nBillie Joe Armstrong - lead vocals, guitar, piano, harmonica (1987-present), \nMike Dirnt - bass, backing vocals (1988-present), rhythm guitar (1987-1988), \nTr√© Cool - drums, percussion, backing vocals (1990-present), \nSession and touring members \nJason White - lead and rhythm guitars, backing vocals (1999-present), \nJason Freese - keyboards, piano, saxophone, trombone, backing vocals (2003-present), \nJeff Matika - rhythm guitar, acoustic guitar, backing vocals (2009-present), \n\nFormer members \nJohn Kiffmeyer - drums, percussion (1987-1990), \nSean Hughes - bass (1987-1988), \nFormer touring members \nTimmy Chunks - guitars (1997-1999), \nGarth Schultz - trombone, trumpet (1997-1999), \nGabrial McNair - trombone, tenor saxophone (1999-2001), \nJeanne Geiger - trombone (2001), \nKurt Lohmiller - trumpet, timpani, percussion, backing vocals (1999-2004), \nMike Pelino - rhythm guitar, backing vocals (2004-2005), \nRonnie Blake - trumpet, timpani, percussion, backing vocals (2004-2005)",

The band has consisted of Billie Joe Armstrong (vocals, guitar), Mike Dirnt (bass guitar, vocals), and Tr√© Cool (drums, percussion) for the majority of its existence.  Green Day was originally part of the punk rock scene at 924 Gilman Street, Berkeley in  East Bay, CA, United States . Its early releases for independent record label Lookout! Records earned them a grassroots fanbase, some of whom felt alienated when the band signed to a major label. Nevertheless, its major label debut Dookie (1994) became a breakout success and eventually sold over 10 million copies in the US. and 15 million worldwide. As a result, Green Day was widely credited, alongside fellow California punk bands The Offspring and Rancid, with reviving mainstream interest in and popularizing punk rock in the United States. Green Day's three follow-up albums, Insomniac, Nimrod and Warning did not achieve the massive success of Dookie, but they were still successful, reaching double platinum, double platinum, and gold status respectively. Green Day's 2004 rock opera American Idiot reignited the band's popularity with a younger generation, selling five million copies in the U.S.The band's eighth studio album, 21st Century Breakdown, was released on May 15, 2009.  Green Day has sold over 22 million records in the United States.They have won three Grammy Awards; Best Alternative Album for Dookie, Best Rock Album for American Idiot, and Record of the Year for Boulevard of Broken Dreams.  In 1987, friends Billie Joe Armstrong and Mike Dirnt, 15 years old at the time, formed a band called Sweet Children. The first Sweet Children show took place on October 17, 1987, at Rod's Hickory Pit in Vallejo, California where Armstrong's mother was working.In 1988, Armstrong and Dirnt began working with former Isocracy drummer, John Kiffmeyer (also known as Al Sobrante). Kiffmeyer served as both the band's drummer and business manager, handling the booking of shows and helping the band establish a fan base.  Larry Livermore, owner of Lookout! Records, saw the band play an early show and signed them to his label. In 1989 they recorded their first EP, 1,000 Hours. Before 1,000 Hours was released, the band dropped the name Sweet Children, according to Livermore this was done in order to avoid confusion with another local band Sweet Baby.The band adopted the name Green Day, allegedly due to their fondness of marijuana.  Lookout! would release Green Day's first LP, 39/Smooth in early 1990. Green Day would record two EPs later that year: Slappy and Sweet Children, the latter of which included some older songs they had recorded for Minneapolis indie label Skene! Records. In 1991, Lookout! Records released 1,039/Smoothed Out Slappy Hours, a compilation of the 39/Smooth, Slappy, and 1,000 Hours EPs. In late 1990, shortly after the band's first nationwide tour, Sobrante left the East Bay area to attend college. The Lookouts drummer Tr√© Cool began filling in as a temporary replacement, and when it became clear that Sobrante did not plan on committing to the band full time, Tr√© Cool's position as Green Day's drummer became permanent. The band went on tour for most of 1992 and 1993, and played a stretch of shows overseas in Europe. The band's second full length album Kerplunk sold about 50,000 copies in the U.S., which was considered quite a large amount for the independent punk scene in 1992.  Kerplunk's underground success led to a wave of interest coming from major record labels, and eventually they left Lookout! on friendly terms and signed with Reprise Records after attracting the attention of producer Rob Cavallo. Signing to Reprise caused many punk rock fans to regard Green Day as sellouts.Reflecting on the period, Armstrong told SPIN magazine in 1999, \"I couldn't go back to the punk scene, whether we were the biggest success in the world or the biggest failure ... The only thing I could do was get on my bike and go forward.\" After signing with Reprise, the band went to work on recording its major label debut, Dookie.  \"Longview\" Play sound Sample of \"Longview\", the first single from Dookie, which combined a memorable bass line with a guitar riff and drums introduced in the chorus. Problems listening to this file? See media help.  \"Basket Case\" Play sound Sample of \"Basket Case\", the third single from Dookie, which was about Armstrong's panic attacks. Problems listening to this file? See media help.  Released in February 1994, and recorded in 3 weeks,Dookie became a commercial success, helped by extensive MTV airplay for the videos of the songs \"Longview\", \"Basket Case\", and \"When I Come Around\", all of which reached the number one position on the Modern Rock Tracks charts. That year, Green Day embarked on a nationwide tour with queercore band Pansy Division as its opening act. At a September 9, 1994 concert at Boston Esplanade, mayhem broke-out during the band's set (cut short to seven songs) and by the end of the rampage, 100 people were injured and 45 arrested. The band also joined the lineups of both the Lollapalooza festival and Woodstock 1994, where they started an infamous mud fight. During the concert, a security guard mistook bassist Mike Dirnt for a stage-invading fan and punched out some of his teeth. Viewed by millions via pay-per-view television, the Woodstock 1994 performance further aided Green Day's growing publicity and recognition, and helped push its album to eventual diamond status. In 1995, Dookie won the Grammy Award for Best Alternative Album and the band was nominated for 9 MTV Video Music Awards including Video of the Year. The full fold-out artwork to Insomniac, entitled God Told Me to Skin You Alive.  In 1995, a new single for the Angus soundtrack was released, titled \"J.A.R.\". The single went straight to number one on the Billboard Modern Rock Tracks chart. The song was followed by the band's new album, Insomniac, which was released in the fall of 1995. Insomniac was a much darker and heavier response by the band, compared to the poppier, more melodic Dookie. Insomniac opened to a warm critical reception, earning 4 out of 5 stars from Rolling Stone, which said \"In punk, the good stuff actually unfolds and gains meaning as you listen without sacrificing any of its electric, haywire immediacy. And Green Day are as good as this stuff gets.\"Insomniac used a piece of art by Winston Smith entitled God Told Me to Skin You Alive for its album cover. The singles released from Insomniac were \"Geek Stink Breath\", \"Brain Stew/Jaded\", \"Walking Contradiction\", and \"Stuck With Me\". Though the album did not approach the success of Dookie, it still sold two million copies in the United States.Insomniac won the band award nominations for Favorite Artist, Favorite Hard Rock Artist, and Favorite Alternative Artist at the 1996 American Music Awards, and the video for \"Walking Contradiction\" got the band a Grammy nomination for Best Video, Short Form, in addition to a Best Special Effects nomination at the MTV Video Music Awards.[20] After that, the band abruptly cancelled a European tour, citing exhaustion.  Middle era: 1997-2002  After taking a break in 1996, Green Day began to work on a new album in 1997. From the outset, both the band and Cavallo agreed that the album had to be different from its previous records.The result was Nimrod, an experimental deviation from the band's standard pop-punk brand of music. The new album was released in October 1997. It provided a variety of music, from pop-punk, surf rock, and ska, to an acoustic ballad. Nimrod entered the charts at number 10. The success of \"Good Riddance (Time of Your Life)\" won the band an MTV Video Award for Best Alternative Video for the song's video, which depicted people undergoing major changes in their lives while Billie Joe Armstrong strummed his acoustic guitar. The song was also used in the second \"clip show\" episode of Seinfeld and on two episodes of ER. The other singles released from Nimrod were \"Nice Guys Finish Last\", \"Hitchin' a Ride\" and \"Redundant\". The band made a guest appearance in an episode of King of the Hill entitled \"The Man Who Shot Cane Skretteberg\", which aired in 1997.  In 2000, Green Day released Warning, a step further in the style that they had hinted at with Nimrod. Critics' reviews of the album were varied.Allmusic gave it 4.5/5 saying \"Warning may not be an innovative record per se, but it's tremendously satisfying.\" Rolling Stone was more critical, giving it 3/5, and saying \"Warning... invites the question: Who wants to listen to songs of faith, hope and social commentary from what used to be snot-core's biggest-selling band?\" Though it produced the hit \"Minority\" and a smaller hit with \"Warning\", some observers were coming to the conclusion that the band was losing relevance,and a decline in popularity followed. While all of Green Day's past albums had reached a status of at least double platinum, Warning was only certified gold.  At the 2001 California Music Awards, Green Day won all eight awards that they were nominated for. They won the awards for Outstanding Album (Warning), Outstanding Punk Rock/Ska Album (Warning), Outstanding Group, Outstanding Male Vocalist, Outstanding Bassist, Outstanding Drummer, Outstanding Songwriter and Outstanding Artist  The release of a Greatest Hits compilation, International Superhits!, and an assemblage of B-sides, Shenanigans, followed Warning. International Superhits and its companion collection of music videos, International Supervideos!, sold reasonably well, going platinum in the U.S. Shenanigans contained some of the band's b-sides, including \"Espionage\" which was featured in Austin Powers: The Spy Who Shagged Me and was nominated for a Grammy for Best Rock Instrumental Performance.  In the spring of 2002, Green Day co-headlined the Pop Disaster Tour with Blink-182. Despite the co-headlining title, Green Day would play each show before Blink-182, who at the time were experiencing more success. The tour was documented on the DVD Riding In Vans With Boys.  American Idiot and renewed popularity: 2003-2006 Spectators watch Green Day from the grass slopes at the National Bowl.  In the summer of 2003 the band went into a studio to write and record new material for a new album, tentatively titled Cigarettes and Valentines. After completing 20 tracks, the master tapes were stolen from the studio. The band chose not to try to re-create the stolen album, but instead started over. By the end of 2003, Green Day collaborated with Iggy Pop on two tracks for his album Skull Ring. On February 1, 2004 a new song, a cover of \"I Fought the Law\" made its debut on a commercial for iTunes during NFL Super Bowl XXXVIII. The band underwent serious \"band therapy,\" engaging in several long talks to work out the members' differences after accusations from Dirnt and Cool that Armstrong was \"the band's Nazi\" and a show-off bent on taking the limelight from the other band members.  The resulting 2004 album, American Idiot, debuted at number one on the Billboard charts, the band's first ever album to top the chart, backed by the success of the album's first single, \"American Idiot.\" The album was billed as a \"punk rock opera\" which follows the journey of the fictitious \"Jesus of Suburbia\". American Idiot won the 2005 Grammy for \"Best Rock Album\" and the band swept the 2005 MTV music awards, winning a total of seven of the eight awards they were nominated for, including the coveted Viewer's Choice Award.  Through 2005, the band toured in support of the album with about 150 dates -- the longest tour in its career -- visiting Japan, Australia, South America and the United Kingdom, where they drew a crowd of 130,000 people over a span of two days. While touring for American Idiot, they filmed and recorded the two concerts at the Milton Keynes National Bowl in England, which was voted 'The Best Show On Earth' in a Kerrang! Magazine Poll.  These recordings were released as a live CD and DVD called Bullet in a Bible on November 15, 2005. This CD/DVD featured hits from American Idiot as well as a few songs from all its previous albums, except \"Kerplunk\" and \"1,039/Smoothed Out Slappy Hours\". The DVD featured behind-the-scenes footage of the band, and showed how the band prepared to put on the show. The final shows of its 2005 world tour were in Sydney, Australia, and Melbourne, Australia, on December 14 and 17 respectively. On January 10, 2006 the band was awarded with a People's Choice Award for favorite group. Green Day live in Germany during the American Idiot tour.  On August 1, 2005, Green Day announced that that it had rescinded the master rights to its pre-Dookie material from Lookout! Records, citing a continuing breach of contract regarding unpaid royalties, a complaint shared with other Lookout! bands. The pre-Dookie material, which remained out of print for about a year, was reissued by the band's current label, Reprise, on January 9, 2007.  In 2006, Green Day won the Grammy Award for Record of the Year for \"Boulevard of Broken Dreams\" which spent 16 weeks at the number one position of Billboard's Modern Rock Tracks, a record it shared along with Red Hot Chili Peppers' \"Scar Tissue\" and Staind's \"It's Been Awhile,\" (the record has been since been beaten by Foo Fighters' 2007 hit \"The Pretender\" which reigned at the top spot for 18 weeks).  Foxboro Hot Tubs and 21st Century Breakdown: 2007 onward  Green Day engaged in several other smaller projects in the time following the hype of American Idiot. In the spring of 2007, Green Day recorded a cover of the John Lennon song \"Working Class Hero\", which appeared on a compilation album \"Instant Karma\", that benefitted victims in Darfur. In the summer of 2007, Green Day recorded a version of The Simpsons theme song for The Simpsons Movie, as well as having an appearance in the movie.  Green Day recently released a new album under the name Foxboro Hot Tubs entitled Stop Drop and Roll!!!. In an interview with Kerrang!, Billie Joe revealed that 2008 would \"be a fair estimate of the release date of their new untitled eighth studio album.\"In a recent interview with Carson Daly, Garbage lead singer Shirley Manson revealed that Butch Vig would be producing Green Day's forthcoming album. In October 2008 Green Day returned to the studios with Butch Vig, to start recording the new studio album. Two videos showing the band in the studio were posted on YouTube. In the tour section of the band's official website, the message \"World Tour coming soon!\" is shown.In the December 9 issue of Alternative Press, in-depth details about the new album were released. According to the interview, Green Day are recording in the same studio as they did for American Idiot, Ocean Way Recording in Hollywood, California. \"This album is more... religious\", and is influenced by Bob Dylan, Bruce Springsteen, and The Beatles, to name a few.Billie Joe Armstrong said when he was being interviewed for Kerrang!'s readers poll, that it will be more power pop than punk rock.The new album is titled 21st Century Breakdown and was released worldwide on May 15, 2009. Green Day will be going on a world tour starting with North America in July, 2009 until sometime in 2010. Singles from 21st Century Breakdown include Know Your Enemy and 21 Guns.  Musical style and influences  Green Day's sound is often compared to first wave punk bands such as the Ramones, The Clash, Sex Pistols, The Jam, and the Buzzcocks. The majority of their song catalog is composed of distorted guitar, fast, manic drums, and relatively high-treble bass. Most of their songs are fast-paced and under four minutes. Billie Joe Armstrong has mentioned that some of his biggest influences are seminal alternative rock bands H√ºsker D√º and The Replacements, and that their influence is particularly noted in the band's chord changes in songs. In fact, Green Day has covered H√ºsker D√º's \"Don't Want to Know If You Are Lonely\" as a b-side for the \"Warning\" single, and the character \"Mr. Whirly\" in their song \"Misery\" is a reference to the Replacements song of the same name. Among other influences, Green Day have also cited Queen,proto-punks The Who, and power pop pioneers Cheap Trick [46]. Armstrong's lyrics commonly describe alienation, (\"Jesus of Suburbia\", \"Boulevard of Broken Dreams\", \"Road to Acceptance\", \"Disappearing Boy\", \"Castaway\") hysteria (\"Basket Case\", \"Panic Song\"), girls (\"She\", \"80\" \"Only of You\",\"Maria\" \"She's a Rebel\"), growing up (\"Longview\" and \"Welcome to Paradise\"), and the effects of doing drugs (\"Geek Stink Breath\", \"Green Day\"). The Ramones had similar lyrical themes such as hysteria (\"Anxiety\", \"Psycho Therapy\"), alienation (\"Outsider\", \"Something To Believe In\"), girls (\"I Wanna Be Your Boyfriend\", \"Sheena Is a Punk Rocker\"), and drugs (\"Now I Wanna Sniff Some Glue\", \"Chinese Rocks\"). Green Day has covered Ramones songs several times, including recording \"Outsider\" for the tribute album We're a Happy Family, and performing \"Blitzkrieg Bop\" and \"Teenage Lobotomy\" when the Ramones were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2002.  Criticism and controversy  Beginning with the release of Dookie, and the subsequent explosion of MTV airplay it received, Green Day has received considerable criticism from those who see the punk genre as a social movement independent of corporate sponsorship. With the release of American Idiot and the subsequent draw of many new fans, much of this criticism has been revived.  One of the more contentious issues is genre labeling. In reaction to both the style of music and the background of the band, many fans and musicians have taken heavy objection to the usage of the term \"punk\" when applied to Green Day. This is evidenced by the following comments issued by John Lydon (Johnny Rotten), former front man of both the 1970s punk band the Sex Pistols and the 1980s post-punk, Public Image Ltd.: \" So there we are fending off all that and it pisses me off that years later a wank outfit like Green Day hop in and nick all that and attach it to themselves. They didn't earn their wings to do that and if they were true punk they wouldn't look anything like they do. \"  Brandon Flowers of The Killers went on record in 2007 claiming that Green Day's politically driven concept album American Idiot displays \"calculated Anti-Americanism.\" He explained that he has problems with the album content itself and also the fact that the band's recent live DVD, Bullet in a Bible, was filmed in England. The taping of the concert, featured on Bullet in a Bible, shows thousands of Europeans singing along to \"American Idiot.\" Stating that he felt Green Day's DVD is a bit of a stunt, he said, \"I just thought it was really cheap. To go to a place like England or Germany and sing that song - those kids aren't taking it the same way that he meant it. And he (Billie Joe Armstrong) knew it.\"  More recently, Oasis guitarist Noel Gallagher has accused the band of ripping off his song \"Wonderwall\" for \"Boulevard of Broken Dreams\".  Related projects Main article: Green Day related projects  Ever since 1991, some members of the band have branched out past Green Day and have started other projects with other musicians. Notable related projects of Green Day include Billie Joe Armstrong's Pinhead Gunpowder (which also features Green Day's live backup guitarist Jason White), The Frustrators in which Mike Dirnt plays bass, and The Network, in which all three members of Green Day play under fake stage names. Billie Joe Armstrong has also confirmed that the main members of Green Day are in the band Foxboro Hot Tubs. A Foxboro Hot Tubs album titled Stop Drop and Roll!!! was released on 2008-05-20.  Charity projects that the band have been involved with include the collaboration with U2 (\"The Saints Are Coming\") to help raise money for musical instruments lost in Hurricane Katrina, and teaming with the Natural Resources Defense Council for the \"Move America Beyond Oil\" campaign and other environmental concerns.  In September 2006, Green Day teamed up with U2 and producer Rick Rubin to record a cover of the song \"The Saints Are Coming\", originally recorded by The Skids, with an accompanying video. The song is to benefit Music Rising, an organization to help raise money for musicians' instruments lost during Hurricane Katrina, and to bring awareness on the eve of the one year anniversary of the disaster.  \"Working Class Hero\" Play sound \"Working Class Hero\", a cover of a John Lennon song, was released on the Instant Karma CD. Problems listening to this file? See media help.  In December 2006, Green Day and NRDC opened a web site in partnership to raise awareness on America's dependency on oil. (See related projects.)  Green Day released a cover of the John Lennon song \"Working Class Hero\", that was featured on the album Instant Karma: The Amnesty International Campaign to Save Darfur. The band performed the song on the season finale of American Idol. The song was nominated for a Grammy in 2008, but lost to The White Stripes' \"Icky Thump\".  That summer, the band appeared in a cameo role in The Simpsons Movie, where they perform the show's theme song. Their version was released as a single on July 24, 2007.

Raised in Northeast Los Angeles and in Northern California, Moore joined the American post-hardcore band From First to Last as the lead singer in 2004, and recorded two studio albums with the band (Dear Diary, My Teen Angst Has a Body Count, 2004, and Heroine, 2006) before leaving to pursue a solo career in 2007. He began his first tour as a solo artist in late 2007. After recruiting a new band lineup, Moore joined the Alternative Press Tour to support bands such as All Time Low and The Rocket Summer, and appeared on the cover of Alternative Press' annual \"100 Bands You Need to Know\" issue. After releasing the Gypsyhook EP in 2009, Moore was scheduled to record his debut studio album, Bells, with producer Noah Shain. However, he ceased production of the album and began performing under the name Skrillex. After releasing the My Name is Skrillex EP for free download on his official MySpace page, he released the Scary Monsters and Nice Sprites EP in late-2010 and More Monsters and Sprites EP in mid-2011. Both have since become moderate commercial successes. On November 30, 2011, he was nominated for a total of five Grammy Awards at the 54th Grammy Awards, including Best New Artist and won three: \"Best Dance/Electronica Album,\" \"Best Dance Recording,\" and \"Best Remixed Recording, Non-Classical\". On December 5, 2011, the BBC announced that he had been nominated for their Sound of 2012 poll. On December 12, 2011, he was also named MTV's Electronic Dance Music Artist of the Year. \n\nBiography:\n\nBackground:\nMoore was born in the Highland Park neighborhood of Northeast Los Angeles, but moved to the Forest Hill neighborhood of San Francisco at the age of two, where he attended elementary school. At the ages of nine and ten, Moore attended a local boarding school located in the Mojave Desert LV, but eventually moved back to Northern California. By the age of twelve, his family moved him back to his birthplace of Northeast L.A., where he enrolled in a private academy school specializing in arts, and was then later home schooled at the age of fourteen due to bullying. In 2004, he learned he was adopted and dropped out of the program when he was sixteen years old. While a young teenager in Los Angeles, Moore would attend punk gigs in Mexican American neighborhoods in East and South Los Angeles, and later on electro club raves in the downtown's Silver Lake and Echo Park neighborhoods. \n\nFrom First to Last (2004-07):\nIn 2004, Moore contacted Matt Good of From First to Last about playing guitar for the band on their debut album. After flying out to Georgia, Moore was heard singing by three studio producers, Derrick Thomas, Eric Dale, and McHale Butler, and was then made lead singer, with Good playing guitar. In June 2004, Epitaph Records released the band's first full-length record with their new bandmate, Dear Diary, My Teen Angst Has a Body Count. After performing on several successful tours, two being the Vans Warped Tour and Dead by Dawn tour, they began recording their second album, Heroine with producer Ross Robinson. The album was released in March 2006 on Epitaph. With high record sales once again, the band found themselves part of many successful tours, until Moore started suffering vocal problems, causing the band to resign from several tours. After going through a successful vocal surgical procedure, Moore informed the band he would be permanently resigning to work on a solo career. FFTL's last show performed with Moore was in their hometown of Orlando at The House of Blues while touring with Atreyu. \n\nSolo career (2007-present):\n\nMoore announced he had left From First to Last to pursue a solo career. He then launched a Myspace page displaying three demos (\"Signal\", \"Equinox\", and \"Glow Worm\"). This led to Moore's first performance since his leaving From First to Last. On April 7, 2007, alongside harpist Carol Robbins, Moore played several original songs at a local art building. After months of releasing demos via Myspace, Moore played on the Team Sleep Tour with a full band. The tour also featured supporting acts Monster in the Machine and Strata. Moore made several demo CDs available on this tour, limited to about 30 per show. These CDs were tour exclusive, and were packaged in \"baby blue envelopes\", each with a unique drawing by Moore or bandmate. In February 2008, Alternative Press Magazine announced the second annual AP Tour, with All Time Low, The Rocket Summer, The Matches, and Forever the Sickest Kids, as well as Sonny Moore. The tour started in Houston, Texas on March 14 and went through North America, ending in Cleveland, Ohio on May 2, with the majority of the shows being sold out. All bands playing the tour would be featured on the cover of Alternative Press Magazine's annual 100 Bands You Need to Know special, and would be interviewed on the Alternative Press Podcast. During this tour Moore's line-up consisted of Sean Friday on drums, Christopher Null on guitar, and Aaron Rothe on keyboards. On April 7, 2009, he released Gypsyhook EP, a digital EP, which featured three songs and four remixes. Also included was a Japanese version of \"Mora\" entitled \"Êµ∑Ê∞¥\" (\"Kaisui\"). Physical copies of the EP were available at his shows. After going on tour with Innerpartysystem and Paper Route and opening for Chiodos on their European tour, Moore performed at Bamboozle on May 2. He performed on Bamboozle Left's Saints and Sinners stage on April 4. He toured with Hollywood Undead in April 2009 performing under the band name Sonny and the Blood Monkeys, with Chris Null (electric guitar), Sean Friday (drums, percussion & beats) and Aaron Rothe (keyboards, synthesizers, programming & turntables) Although no official statement has been given regarding the album, Moore has stated that Bells will no longer be released. \n\nProduction career:\n\nIn 2008, Moore began producing and performing under the alias Skrillex at clubs in the Los Angeles area. Previously, he had been known on the Internet as Twipz. On June 7, 2010, Moore released his official Skrillex debut EP, My Name is Skrillex as a free download. Moore provided programming and vocals for UK metalcore band Bring Me the Horizon on their third studio album, There Is a Hell, Believe Me I've Seen It. There Is a Heaven, Let's Keep It a Secret. Later in the year, Sonny began a nationwide tour with Deadmau5 after being signed to mau5trap recordings and released his second EP, Scary Monsters and Nice Sprites. Moore kicked off the \"Project Blue Book Tour\" in 2011 with support from Porter Robinson, Tommy Lee and DJ Aero as well as appearances from Sofia Toufa for a new song titled \"Bring out the Devil.\" Skrillex unveiled several new songs on this tour including \"First Of The Year\" (formerly known as \"Equinox\"), \"Reptile\", and \"Cinema\" (remix of a Benny Benassi track). \"Reptile\" was featured in the TV commercial for Mortal Kombat 9, and \"First of the Year (Equinox)\" is featured on his follow up EP and remix companion to Scary Monsters and Nice Sprites, titled More Monsters and Sprites. In April 2011, Spin magazine premiered \"Get Up\", an exclusive new track from Korn that was produced by Skrillex. Korn made \"Get Up\" available for free download via their Facebook page. On April 15, 2011 KoRn joined Skrillex on stage for his set at Coachella 2011. On April 18, 2011, Sony Computer Entertainment (SCEA) development studio Naughty Dog released a trailer for the multiplayer component of their PlayStation 3 game Uncharted 3: Drake's Deception, featuring \"Kill EVERYBODY\" from Scary Monsters and Nice Sprites. In June 2011, \"More Monsters and Sprites\" was released on Beatport, an EP consisting of three original tracks, including \"First of the Year (Equinox)\" and two versions of his original track \"Ruffneck\". A leaked track entitled \"Ruffneck Bass\" had been leaked on the internet months prior which used the same sample as in the new \"Ruffneck\" tracks on the EP. Skrillex released a music video for \"Rock n' Roll (Will Take You to the Mountain)\" on his official YouTube page on June 20, 2011. \n\nOn August 17, 2011 Skrillex announced his label, OWSLA. \"The label's first releases will come from Bristol-based dubstep producer Koan Sound, electro-house newcomer Porter Robinson from North Carolina, singer/songwriter Alvin Risk, and San Francisco-based M Machine (formally Metropolis).\" Skrillex released a music video for \"First of the Year (Equinox)\" via Spin.com on August 19, 2011. In late August 2011 it was released that he would be appearing Knife Party's first release, collaborating on a Moombahton style track entitled \"Zoology\". A preview was released on YouTube. In late September 2011 he created the track \"Syndicate\" as promotion for the video game of the same name. Kaskade's 2011 album Fire & Ice features a collaboration between Kaskade and Skrillex entitled \"Lick It\". The video for Skrillex's song \"First of the Year (Equinox)\" appears on the first episode of the Beavis and Butt-head revival. On November 8, Skrillex stated that he intended to release an album entitled Voltage. Skrillex gave fans more info about Voltage in RockSound Magazine after a photoshoot for the cover and doing an extensive interview on his tour. For unknown reasons, however, the album was never released. On December 21, 2011, Skrillex unveiled the Bangarang EP for a Beatport release on December 23. On March 13, 2012, Beatport released OWSLA's second Free Treats sampler, Free Treats Vol. 2. The 19-track compilation features \"Ruffneck (FULL Flex) Munchi Anonymous Revolution Remix\", a remixed track by Skrillex. This new take on the track deviates from the original (released on the More Monsters and Sprites EP), with the remix being more characteristic of Electro House, though with a much slower tempo of 108 BPM, versus the original version's classic Dubstep tempo of 140 BPM, also straying from the typical Electro House tempo of 128 BPM. On August 12, 2012, his new side-project formed with Boys Noize called Dog Blood released an EP called Next Order/Middle Finger. \n\nInfluences:\nMoore has stated in an online interview that he has been a longtime fan of Warp, an electronic music label that has released recordings from artists such as Aphex Twin and Squarepusher. \n\nPersonal life:\nAs of February 2012, Skrillex has been dating fellow artist and singer, Ellie Goulding, who provided vocals for the Skrillex track, \"Summit\", featured on the EP, Bangarang.",

Raised in Northeast Los Angeles and in Northern California, Moore joined the American post-hardcore band From First to Last as the lead singer in 2004, and recorded two studio albums with the band (Dear Diary, My Teen Angst Has a Body Count, 2004, and Heroine, 2006) before leaving to pursue a solo career in 2007. He began his first tour as a solo artist in late 2007. After recruiting a new band lineup, Moore joined the Alternative Press Tour to support bands such as All Time Low and The Rocket Summer, and appeared on the cover of Alternative Press' annual \"100 Bands You Need to Know\" issue. After releasing the Gypsyhook EP in 2009, Moore was scheduled to record his debut studio album, Bells, with producer Noah Shain. However, he ceased production of the album and began performing under the name Skrillex. After releasing the My Name is Skrillex EP for free download on his official MySpace page, he released the Scary Monsters and Nice Sprites EP in late-2010 and More Monsters and Sprites EP in mid-2011. Both have since become moderate commercial successes. On November 30, 2011, he was nominated for a total of five Grammy Awards at the 54th Grammy Awards, including Best New Artist and won three: \"Best Dance/Electronica Album,\" \"Best Dance Recording,\" and \"Best Remixed Recording, Non-Classical\". On December 5, 2011, the BBC announced that he had been nominated for their Sound of 2012 poll. On December 12, 2011, he was also named MTV's Electronic Dance Music Artist of the Year. \n\nBiography:\n\nBackground:\nMoore was born in the Highland Park neighborhood of Northeast Los Angeles, but moved to the Forest Hill neighborhood of San Francisco at the age of two, where he attended elementary school. At the ages of nine and ten, Moore attended a local boarding school located in the Mojave Desert LV, but eventually moved back to Northern California. By the age of twelve, his family moved him back to his birthplace of Northeast L.A., where he enrolled in a private academy school specializing in arts, and was then later home schooled at the age of fourteen due to bullying. In 2004, he learned he was adopted and dropped out of the program when he was sixteen years old. While a young teenager in Los Angeles, Moore would attend punk gigs in Mexican American neighborhoods in East and South Los Angeles, and later on electro club raves in the downtown's Silver Lake and Echo Park neighborhoods. \n\nFrom First to Last (2004-07):\nIn 2004, Moore contacted Matt Good of From First to Last about playing guitar for the band on their debut album. After flying out to Georgia, Moore was heard singing by three studio producers, Derrick Thomas, Eric Dale, and McHale Butler, and was then made lead singer, with Good playing guitar. In June 2004, Epitaph Records released the band's first full-length record with their new bandmate, Dear Diary, My Teen Angst Has a Body Count. After performing on several successful tours, two being the Vans Warped Tour and Dead by Dawn tour, they began recording their second album, Heroine with producer Ross Robinson. The album was released in March 2006 on Epitaph. With high record sales once again, the band found themselves part of many successful tours, until Moore started suffering vocal problems, causing the band to resign from several tours. After going through a successful vocal surgical procedure, Moore informed the band he would be permanently resigning to work on a solo career. FFTL's last show performed with Moore was in their hometown of Orlando at The House of Blues while touring with Atreyu. \n\nSolo career (2007-present):\n\nMoore announced he had left From First to Last to pursue a solo career. He then launched a Myspace page displaying three demos (\"Signal\", \"Equinox\", and \"Glow Worm\"). This led to Moore's first performance since his leaving From First to Last. On April 7, 2007, alongside harpist Carol Robbins, Moore played several original songs at a local art building. After months of releasing demos via Myspace, Moore played on the Team Sleep Tour with a full band. The tour also featured supporting acts Monster in the Machine and Strata. Moore made several demo CDs available on this tour, limited to about 30 per show. These CDs were tour exclusive, and were packaged in \"baby blue envelopes\", each with a unique drawing by Moore or bandmate. In February 2008, Alternative Press Magazine announced the second annual AP Tour, with All Time Low, The Rocket Summer, The Matches, and Forever the Sickest Kids, as well as Sonny Moore. The tour started in Houston, Texas on March 14 and went through North America, ending in Cleveland, Ohio on May 2, with the majority of the shows being sold out. All bands playing the tour would be featured on the cover of Alternative Press Magazine's annual 100 Bands You Need to Know special, and would be interviewed on the Alternative Press Podcast. During this tour Moore's line-up consisted of Sean Friday on drums, Christopher Null on guitar, and Aaron Rothe on keyboards. On April 7, 2009, he released Gypsyhook EP, a digital EP, which featured three songs and four remixes. Also included was a Japanese version of \"Mora\" entitled \"Êµ∑Ê∞¥\" (\"Kaisui\"). Physical copies of the EP were available at his shows. After going on tour with Innerpartysystem and Paper Route and opening for Chiodos on their European tour, Moore performed at Bamboozle on May 2. He performed on Bamboozle Left's Saints and Sinners stage on April 4. He toured with Hollywood Undead in April 2009 performing under the band name Sonny and the Blood Monkeys, with Chris Null (electric guitar), Sean Friday (drums, percussion & beats) and Aaron Rothe (keyboards, synthesizers, programming & turntables) Although no official statement has been given regarding the album, Moore has stated that Bells will no longer be released. \n\nProduction career:\n\nIn 2008, Moore began producing and performing under the alias Skrillex at clubs in the Los Angeles area. Previously, he had been known on the Internet as Twipz. On June 7, 2010, Moore released his official Skrillex debut EP, My Name is Skrillex as a free download. Moore provided programming and vocals for UK metalcore band Bring Me the Horizon on their third studio album, There Is a Hell, Believe Me I've Seen It. There Is a Heaven, Let's Keep It a Secret. Later in the year, Sonny began a nationwide tour with Deadmau5 after being signed to mau5trap recordings and released his second EP, Scary Monsters and Nice Sprites. Moore kicked off the \"Project Blue Book Tour\" in 2011 with support from Porter Robinson, Tommy Lee and DJ Aero as well as appearances from Sofia Toufa for a new song titled \"Bring out the Devil.\" Skrillex unveiled several new songs on this tour including \"First Of The Year\" (formerly known as \"Equinox\"), \"Reptile\", and \"Cinema\" (remix of a Benny Benassi track). \"Reptile\" was featured in the TV commercial for Mortal Kombat 9, and \"First of the Year (Equinox)\" is featured on his follow up EP and remix companion to Scary Monsters and Nice Sprites, titled More Monsters and Sprites. In April 2011, Spin magazine premiered \"Get Up\", an exclusive new track from Korn that was produced by Skrillex. Korn made \"Get Up\" available for free download via their Facebook page. On April 15, 2011 KoRn joined Skrillex on stage for his set at Coachella 2011. On April 18, 2011, Sony Computer Entertainment (SCEA) development studio Naughty Dog released a trailer for the multiplayer component of their PlayStation 3 game Uncharted 3: Drake's Deception, featuring \"Kill EVERYBODY\" from Scary Monsters and Nice Sprites. In June 2011, \"More Monsters and Sprites\" was released on Beatport, an EP consisting of three original tracks, including \"First of the Year (Equinox)\" and two versions of his original track \"Ruffneck\". A leaked track entitled \"Ruffneck Bass\" had been leaked on the internet months prior which used the same sample as in the new \"Ruffneck\" tracks on the EP. Skrillex released a music video for \"Rock n' Roll (Will Take You to the Mountain)\" on his official YouTube page on June 20, 2011. \n\nOn August 17, 2011 Skrillex announced his label, OWSLA. \"The label's first releases will come from Bristol-based dubstep producer Koan Sound, electro-house newcomer Porter Robinson from North Carolina, singer/songwriter Alvin Risk, and San Francisco-based M Machine (formally Metropolis).\" Skrillex released a music video for \"First of the Year (Equinox)\" via Spin.com on August 19, 2011. In late August 2011 it was released that he would be appearing Knife Party's first release, collaborating on a Moombahton style track entitled \"Zoology\". A preview was released on YouTube. In late September 2011 he created the track \"Syndicate\" as promotion for the video game of the same name. Kaskade's 2011 album Fire & Ice features a collaboration between Kaskade and Skrillex entitled \"Lick It\". The video for Skrillex's song \"First of the Year (Equinox)\" appears on the first episode of the Beavis and Butt-head revival. On November 8, Skrillex stated that he intended to release an album entitled Voltage. Skrillex gave fans more info about Voltage in RockSound Magazine after a photoshoot for the cover and doing an extensive interview on his tour. For unknown reasons, however, the album was never released. On December 21, 2011, Skrillex unveiled the Bangarang EP for a Beatport release on December 23. On March 13, 2012, Beatport released OWSLA's second Free Treats sampler, Free Treats Vol. 2. The 19-track compilation features \"Ruffneck (FULL Flex) Munchi Anonymous Revolution Remix\", a remixed track by Skrillex. This new take on the track deviates from the original (released on the More Monsters and Sprites EP), with the remix being more characteristic of Electro House, though with a much slower tempo of 108 BPM, versus the original version's classic Dubstep tempo of 140 BPM, also straying from the typical Electro House tempo of 128 BPM. On August 12, 2012, his new side-project formed with Boys Noize called Dog Blood released an EP called Next Order/Middle Finger. \n\nInfluences:\nMoore has stated in an online interview that he has been a longtime fan of Warp, an electronic music label that has released recordings from artists such as Aphex Twin and Squarepusher. \n\nPersonal life:\nAs of February 2012, Skrillex has been dating fellow artist and singer, Ellie Goulding, who provided vocals for the Skrillex track, \"Summit\", featured on the EP, Bangarang.",

He is best known as the guitarist and lead vocalist of the rock duo The White Stripes (1997-2011) and more recently guitarist and vocalist of The Raconteurs, and drummer and vocalist for the band The Dead Weather.  Jack White first played as a professional musician in the early 1990s, as a drummer for the Detroit cowpunk band Goober & the Peas. White produced Loretta Lynn's Van Lear Rose in 2004, which won them a Grammy for best country album, and an additional Grammy for best country collaboration for the song Portland Oregon.    The Love Interruption Songfacts reports that his debut solo single, Love Interruption, was made available on January 30, 2012 at White's pay-to-join club Vault and at Jackwhiteiii.com. A week later, it was released on the singer's preferred format, vinyl. It was produced by the ex White Stripe and recorded at his own Third Man Studio in Nashville along with its exclusive non-LP B-side Machine Gun Silhouette. This was followed by his first solo album, Blunderbuss, later in 2012, and an accompanying tour. This is not said to indicate an end to either the Raconteurs or the Dead Weather.  His blaring guitar solos and ability to pull sound from the simplest of \"instruments\" are his greatest strengths along with his desire to partner with female vocalists.  He currently resides in Tennessee. He announced his divorce in 2011 from wife since 2005, fellow musician Karen Elson, and they have two children. Third Man Records (White's label) and Elson's clothing boutique are also located there.  Last.fm Group: http://www.last.fm/group/Blunderbuss",

He was awarded the title of \"Nashville Music City Ambassador\" by the Nashville mayor Karl Dean in 2011. \n\nEarly life:\nOf Polish, Scottish, and Canadian descent, John Anthony Gillis, the son of Teresa and Gorman Gillis, was born the youngest of ten children (six brothers, three sisters) in a lower middle-class neighborhood in Detroit, Michigan. He grew up in a Catholic family. His father and mother worked for the Archdiocese of Detroit, as the Building Maintenance Superintendent and secretary in the Cardinal's office, respectively. White eventually became an altar boy, which landed him an uncredited role in the 1987 movie The Rosary Murders, filmed mainly at Holy Redeemer parish in southwest Detroit. As a child he was a fan of classical music. He attended Cass Technical High School in Detroit. He began playing an instrument, a drum, at the age of six. As a teenager, White was already listening to the blues and 1960s rock that would influence him in The White Stripes,Son House and Blind Willie McTell being among his favorite blues musicians. He and his childhood friend, Dominic Suchyta (NKA Dominic Davis), would listen to records in White's attic on weekends and began to record cover songs on an old four-track reel to reel tape machine. At the time White was described as \"a kid with short hair and braces\". He has said in many interviews that Son House's \"Grinnin' In Your Face\" is his favorite song of all time. In 2005 on 60 Minutes, White told Mike Wallace that his life could have turned out differently. \"I'd got accepted to a seminary in Wisconsin, and I was gonna become a priest, but at the last second I thought, 'I'll just go to public school. I had just gotten a new amplifier in my bedroom, and I didn't think I was allowed to take it with me.\" At 15, White began a three-year upholstery apprenticeship with a family friend, Brian Muldoon. White credits Muldoon with exposing him to punk music and pushing him to play music with Muldoon as a band: \"He played drums, well I guess I'll play guitar then.\" The two recorded an album, Makers of High Grade Suites, as The Upholsterers. White later started a one-man business of his own, Third Man Upholstery. The slogan of his business was \"Your Furniture's Not Dead\" and the color scheme was yellow and black--including a yellow van, a yellow-and-black uniform, and a yellow clipboard. Although Third Man Upholstery never lacked business, White claims that it was unprofitable, because of his complacency about money and his business practices that were perceived as unprofessional, including making bills out in crayon and writing poetry inside the furniture. Shortly thereafter, White landed his first professional gig, as the drummer for the Detroit band Goober & the Peas. He also played in other local bands and did solo shows. \n\nRecording career:\n\nThe White Stripes:\n\nWhite formed The White Stripes in 1997, along with Meg White, The band began its career as part of the Michigan garage rock underground music scene, playing with local bands such as Bantam Rooster, The Dirtbombs, The Paybacks, Rocket 455, and The Henchmen, among others. In 1998, The White Stripes were signed to Italy Records, a small and independent Detroit-based garage punk label, by Dave Buick. The band released its self-titled debut album in 1999, and a year later the album was followed up by the cult classicDe Stijl. The album eventually peaked at No. 38 in Billboard's Independent Albums chart when the band had established their popularity. While performing and in music videos, Jack and Meg are very recognisable visually, as they dress only in red, white, and black. In 2001 the band released White Blood Cells. The album's stripped-down garage rock sound drew critical acclaim in the UK and soon afterward in the US, making The White Stripes one of the more acclaimed bands of 2002. The album was followed up in 2003 by the commercially and critically successfulElephant. Allmusic wrote that the album \"sounds even more pissed-off, paranoid and stunning than its predecessor ... darker and more difficult than White Blood Cells. \" The album's first single, \"Seven Nation Army\", was the band's most successful. The band's fifth album, Get Behind Me Satan, was recorded in White's own home and marked a change in the band's musical direction, with piano-driven melodies and experimentation with marimba and a more rhythm-based guitar playing by White. The band's sixth album Icky Thump, released in 2007, entered the UK Albums Chart at number one and debuted at number two on the Billboard 200. The album's sound also included more punk, garage and blues influences than its predecessor. In late 2007, the band announced the cancellation of 18 tour dates due to Meg White's acute anxiety problems. White had revealed plans to release a seventh, as of yet untitled album in the summer of 2009. However, this has yet to happen. The band also made their first live appearance since Meg's anxiety problems in September 2007 on the final episode of Late Night with Conan O'Brien on February 20, 2009. A documentary, The White Stripes: Under Great White Northern Lights, about the band's 2007 tour, in which they played a gig in every Canadian province and territory, appeared in the 2009 Toronto International Film Festival. In July 2007, The White Stripes made history by playing the shortest concert ever only playing one note, in St John's, Newfoundland. They played a full show later that night at the Mile One Centre in downtown St. John's. On February 2, 2011, it was reported on the main page of whitestripes.com that the duo has decided to part ways. White stated that it was not due to health issues or artistic differences but there were a \"myriad of reasons\". \n\nThe Raconteurs:\nWhite formed The Raconteurs in 2005 along with Brendan Benson, Jack Lawrence and Patrick Keeler. The origin of the band was the song 'Steady, As She Goes' which White wrote along with Benson. This inspired them to create a full band with the addition of Lawrence and Keeler. The band came together in Detroit during 2005 and, for the remainder of the year, recorded when time allowed. The band's debut album Broken Boy Soldiers was recorded at Benson's home in Detroit. The band set out on tour to support the album, including eight dates as the opening act for Bob Dylan. The group's second album, Consolers of the Lonely, and its first single, \"Salute Your Solution\", simultaneously in 2008. The album received a Grammy nomination. \n\nThe Dead Weather:\n\nIn early 2009, Jack White formed a new group called The Dead Weather with The Kills frontwoman Alison Mosshart. White takes drum and vocal duties, while The Raconteurs bassist Jack Lawrence and Queens of the Stone Age keyboardist and guitarist Dean Fertita round the four piece out. The group debuted a handful of new tracks on March 11, 2009 in Nashville from their debut album Horehound, which came out July 13, 2009 in Europe and July 14, 2009 in North America, on White's Third Man Records label. On October 16, 2009, Mosshart confirmed that the second album was \"halfway done\". The first single \"Die by the Drop\" was released on March 30, 2010. The new album, Sea of Cowards was released on May 7 in Ireland, then on May 11, 2010, in the U.S. and May 10 in the United Kingdom, and again, on White's Third Man Records. \n\nSolo career:\nIt was rumored that in 2003 White collaborated on Electric Six's song \"Danger! High Voltage.\" Both he and the Electric Six denied this, and the vocal work was credited officially to John S O'Leary. However, a recent radio interview with Tim Shaw on Kerrang! 105.2 in the UK had Electric Six lead singer Dick Valentine talking openly about White singing on this song as well as speculating on the amount of money he was paid ($60,000). Also, a Q magazine article stated that Jack White did in fact work with Electric Six on the song \"Gay Bar\". In 2008, White collaborated with Alicia Keys on the song \"Another Way to Die\", the theme song for the James Bond film Quantum of Solace. He performed five songs for the Cold Mountain soundtrack; \"Sittin' on Top of the World\", \"Wayfaring Stranger\", \"Never Far Away\", \"Christmas Time Soon Will Be Over\" and \"Great High Mountain\". In 2009, Jack White was featured in It Might Get Loud, a film in which he, Jimmy Page, and The Edge come together to discuss the electric guitar and each artist's different playing methods. White's first solo single, \"Fly Farm Blues,\" was written and recorded in 10 minutes during the filming of the movie, in August 2009. The single went on sale as a 7-inch vinyl record from Third Man Records and as a digital single available through iTunes on August 11. In November 2010, producer Danger Mouse announced that White has been recruited for his collaboration with Daniele Luppi entitled Rome along with Norah Jones. White provided vocals to three songs on the album: \"The Rose with the Broken Neck,\" \"Two Against One\" and \"The World.\" The song \"You Know That I Know\", finished and performed by White, was featured on The Lost Notebooks of Hank Williams, released on October 4, 2011. On January 30, 2012 White released \"Love Interruption\" as the first single of his debut solo album, Blunderbuss, which was released on April 24, 2012. On March 3, 2012, he appeared on Saturday Night Live as the musical guest, with Lindsay Lohan hosting. He'll be playing selected dates in the summer, with festivals such as Radio 1's Hackney Weekend, Sasquatch! Music Festival, Fuji Rock Festival in Japan, one of the biggest festivals in the world, Rock Werchter in Belgium, and later in the year, he'll be headlining Austin City Limits Music Festival. For his solo shows, White tours with two bands. One, The Peacocks, is all-female, and the other, The Buzzards (sometimes called Los Buzzardos), is all-male. \n\nMusical equipment and sound:\nThe guitars White uses live are two 1965 JB Hutto Montgomery Airlines (one which he received from a fan), a three pickup Airline Town & Country (used on tour with the Raconteurs and in the \"Steady As She Goes\" music video), a Harmony Rocket, a 1970s-era Crestwood Astral II, 1950s-era Kay Hollowbody (given to him by his brother in return for a favor), a Gretsch White Penguin (as seen in the music video for Icky Thump), and a custom Gretsch Rancher Falcon acoustic guitar. When playing with the Raconteurs, White usually plays two custom Gretsch-styled copies of the Duo Jet double-cutaway guitar, which were made in collaboration with his Seattle luthier, Randy Parsons. His main guitar is dubbed the Triple Jet, which is made of copper and features a Gretsch logo from 1912. For their first tour, Jack also played Gretsch Anniversary Jr. with a Bigsby vibrato tailpiece and three Filtertron pickups. He also uses a Gretsch Rancher acoustic guitar and he now uses a custom Gretsch Anniversary Jr. with two cutaways, a built-in retractable microphone, and a theremin next to the Bigsby. Jack has dubbed this one the \"Triple Green Machine\". Also, he plays occasionally with his Gretsch Rancher, a Gibson J-160E. Also, he plays a Gretsch Duo Jet in Cadillac Green. Recently, he has featured his latest Gretsch, a custom white Billy Gibbons/Bo Diddley signature Gretsch Jupiter Thunderbird in the music video for \"Another Way to Die\", this guitar is also used on his concerts with The Dead Weather, but he also uses a black left-handed one since Sea of Cowards came out. He has also been known to play Fender Telecasters, featuring one in the music video for Loretta Lynn's \"Portland, Oregon\". Jack White has also played in live shows, mainly with The Dead Weather, a Daddy Mojo Stove Pipe Cigar Box Guitar. White uses numerous effects to create his live sound, most notably a DigiTech Whammy WH-4 to create the rapid modulations in pitch he uses in his solos. In concert with an MXR Micro Amp and custom Electro-Harmonix Big Muff Distortion/Sustainer, White can produce a very distinctive sound. In 2005, for the single \"Blue Orchid,\" White employed a new Electro-Harmonix creation, the Polyphonic Octave Generator (POG). Similar to (but more versatile than) the Whammy IV, the POG lets the user mix in several octave effects into one along with the dry signal. He also has three Z.Vex Tremolo Probes, that are hand painted black. All of the pedals that he uses live have been professionally painted red to match his red/black/white color scheme (with the exception of his Whammy and the other pedals that are already red). He plugs this setup into a 1970s Fender Twin Reverb and two 100-Watt Sears Silvertone 6x10 combo amplifiers. He also has a Sonic Machine Factory 15 Watt amp in red that can be seen in Under Great White Northern Lights. He uses this as a travel amp for secret or small shows, and also as the amp for his various keyboards when playing for a larger audience. With the Raconteurs, he has many more unusual pedals. And also, for the Raconteurs' 2008 tour, he had all of his pedals copper plated by Analog Man. White also produces a \"fake\" bass tone by playing the Kay Hollowbody and JB Hutto Montgomery Airline guitars through a Whammy IV set to one octave down for a very thick, low, rumbling sound, which he uses most notably on the songs \"Seven Nation Army\" and \"The Hardest Button to Button\" during live performances. On occasion, White also plays other instruments, such as a Black Gibson F-4 mandolin (\"Little Ghost\"), piano (on most tracks from Get Behind Me Satan, and various others), and an electric piano on such tracks as \"The Air Near My Fingers\" and \"I'm Finding it Harder to be a Gentleman\". White also plays percussion instruments such as the marimba (as on \"The Nurse\"), drums and tambourine. For the White Stripes' 2007 tour, he played a custom-finish Hammond A-100 organ with a Leslie 3300 speaker, which was subsequently loaned to Bob Dylan, and currently resides at Third Man Studios. On Broken Boy Soldiers, he is credited as playing the album's synths and organ; however, bandmate Brendan Benson also received credit for these instruments and it is unclear who played on which song. With the Dead Weather, Jack plays a custom Ludwig Classic Maple kit in Black Oyster Pearl. The sizes consist of the following: 16x26 kick, 5x16 snare (primary) 12x14 marching snare (secondary), 7x16 rack tom 14x16 floor tom, two 16x16 floor toms, Paiste 2002 24\"crash, 24\"ride and two 16\" crashes as hi-hats. For the 2009 Full Flash Blank tour, Jack used a drum head with the Three Brides of Dracula on the front, but in 2010, Jack employs a new drum head, upon the release of Sea of Cowards, which has an image of The Third Man himself: Harry Lime attempting to escape certain capture in the sewers of Vienna. During the American leg of the 2010 tour, Jack switched his drum head again featuring a picture of himself in the guise he wore on the cover of Sea of Cowards. This drum head is called Sam Kay by some fans, referring to the insert inside of the 12\" LP. In 2010, Jack White added an acoustic guitar to his collection named Veronica Lake. It is a custom white Gretsch Rancher with a gold double pickguard and a picture of Veronica Lake on the back. He is currently playing it with his band The Dead Weather. It is the newest addition to \"Jack's Girlfriends\" which already include Claudette Colbert that he plays In the Raconteurs, and Rita Hayworth that he plays in the White Stripes. According to Joe Chiccarelli, engineer for Icky Thump, White is not very technical when it comes to capturing his sound on record: \"Usually he wouldn't talk in terms of compression or EQ or any of those things, it was always about what can we do to give something more aggression or hit you in the face more. Jack's brilliance is his understanding of great emotional performances, and of what it takes to make something come alive through the speakers and have an impact.\" \n\nPersonal life:\n\nWhite gives few interviews and reveals few details of his private life. He states that he does not consider it relevant to his art, saying \"It's the same thing as asking Michelangelo, 'What kind of shoes do you wear?'...In the end, it doesn't really matter ... the only thing that's going to be left is our records and photos.\" A topic of intrigue has been the actual relationship between Jack and Meg White. In early interviews, the pair presented themselves as siblings, two of ten. The Flaming Lips touch on this in their song \"Thank You Jack White (for the Fiber-Optic Jesus That You Gave Me)\" released on their 2003 EP Fight Test. However, the Detroit Free Press produced copies of both a marriage license and divorce certificate, confirming Jack and Meg's history as a married couple. Neither addresses the truth officially and over time, they have become less verbal about the origins of their relationship. Jack White has said, though, that siblings are \"mated for life\", thus such relationships distract less from the music. Jack mentions them being brother and sister in the documentary Under Great White Northern Lights. In the early 1990s, Meg White worked as a bartender at Memphis Smoke, a bar in downtown Royal Oak (a Detroit suburb), where she first met Jack, then still known under his original surname 'Gillis'. They were married on September 21, 1996 and were divorced on March 24, 2000. Jack took her last name. White is often referred to as eccentric. For instance, he has an obsession with the number three. On November 7, 2005, it was widely reported that White had changed his name to \"Three Quid\" (quid is British slang for pound sterling). However, most reports indicated that this would only last until the end of the tour. On December 13, 2003, White was involved in an altercation with Jason Stollsteimer, lead singer of The Von Bondies, at the Magic Stick, a Detroit club. White was charged with misdemeanor aggravated assault. He pleaded guilty to the lesser charge of assault and battery, and was fined $750 (including court costs), and was sentenced to take anger management classes. In 2003, White made his acting debut in Mutant Swinger from Mars, and had a brief but highly publicized romantic relationship with actress Ren√©e Zellweger, whom he met during the filming of Cold Mountain. That summer, the couple were in a car accident in which White broke his left index finger and was forced to reschedule much of the summer tour. He posted the footage of his finger surgery on the web for fans. White and Zellweger's breakup became public in December 2004. White met British model Karen Elson (twin sister of Kate Elson) when she appeared in The White Stripes music video for \"Blue Orchid\". The video's director, Floria Sigismondi, noted \"you sensed an energy between them\". They married on June 1, 2005 in Manaus, Brazil. The wedding took place in a canoe on the Amazon River and was officiated by a shaman. A Roman Catholic priest later convalidated their marriage. Manager Ian Montone was the best man and Meg White was the maid of honor. Official wedding announcements stated that \"it was the first marriage\" for both. On May 2, 2006, the couple had a daughter, Scarlett Teresa White. Their second child, Henry Lee White, was born on August 7, 2007. The White family resides in Brentwood, Tennessee, a suburb south of Nashville, where Elson managed a vintage clothing store called Venus & Mars. The couple announced their divorce in June 2011, throwing a divorce party to celebrate their sixth anniversary and the \"making and breaking of the sacred union of marriage,\" according to the invitation sent to guests. In a press statement, the couple vowed to remain \"dear and trusted friends and co-parents.\" It is rumored that Karen Elson is \"Mildred\" of the Third Man Records produced album, \"Mildred and The Mice\". In 2006, it was revealed in the Sunday Times Rich List that White and his British wife Elson had a joint fortune of at least ¬£20 million (US$37 million). This ranked them at seventh place in the list of entertainers under age 30 who were born or live in the United Kingdom, ahead of the likes of Orlando Bloom and Kate Winslet. \n\nTV appearances:\nOn January 9, 2012, Jack White appeared on American Pickers. In the episode Jack trades his photo booth, first Jukebox, and US$6,000 for a taxidermy elephant head. Jack White appeared as a guest of The Colbert Report in three consecutive episodes in 2011 (June 21-23), and again on April 26, 2012.",

After releasing the Gypsyhook EP in 2009, Moore was scheduled to record his debut studio album, Bells, with producer Noah Shain. However, he ceased production of the album and began performing under the name Skrillex. After releasing the My Name is Skrillex EP for free download on his official MySpace page, he released the Scary Monsters and Nice Sprites EP in late-2010 and More Monsters and Sprites EP in mid-2011. Both have since become moderate commercial successes. On November 30, 2011, he was nominated for a total of five Grammy Awards at the 54th Grammy Awards, including Best New Artist and won three: \"Best Dance/Electronica Album,\" \"Best Dance Recording,\" and \"Best Remixed Recording, Non-Classical\". On December 5, 2011, the BBC announced that he had been nominated for their Sound of 2012 poll. On December 12, 2011, he was also named MTV's Electronic Dance Music Artist of the Year. \n\nBiography:\n\nBackground:\nMoore was born in the Highland Park neighborhood of Northeast Los Angeles, but moved to the Forest Hill neighborhood of San Francisco at the age of two, where he attended elementary school. At the ages of nine and ten, Moore attended a local boarding school located in the Mojave Desert LV, but eventually moved back to Northern California. By the age of twelve, his family moved him back to his birthplace of Northeast L.A., where he enrolled in a private academy school specializing in arts, and was then later home schooled at the age of fourteen due to bullying. In 2004, he learned he was adopted and dropped out of the program when he was sixteen years old. While a young teenager in Los Angeles, Moore would attend punk gigs in Mexican American neighborhoods in East and South Los Angeles, and later on electro club raves in the downtown's Silver Lake and Echo Park neighborhoods. \n\nFrom First to Last (2004-07):\nIn 2004, Moore contacted Matt Good of From First to Last about playing guitar for the band on their debut album. After flying out to Georgia, Moore was heard singing by three studio producers, Derrick Thomas, Eric Dale, and McHale Butler, and was then made lead singer, with Good playing guitar. In June 2004, Epitaph Records released the band's first full-length record with their new bandmate, Dear Diary, My Teen Angst Has a Body Count. After performing on several successful tours, two being the Vans Warped Tour and Dead by Dawn tour, they began recording their second album, Heroine with producer Ross Robinson. The album was released in March 2006 on Epitaph. With high record sales once again, the band found themselves part of many successful tours, until Moore started suffering vocal problems, causing the band to resign from several tours. After going through a successful vocal surgical procedure, Moore informed the band he would be permanently resigning to work on a solo career. FFTL's last show performed with Moore was in their hometown of Orlando at The House of Blues while touring with Atreyu. \n\nSolo career (2007-present):\n\nMoore announced he had left From First to Last to pursue a solo career. He then launched a Myspace page displaying three demos (\"Signal\", \"Equinox\", and \"Glow Worm\"). This led to Moore's first performance since his leaving From First to Last. On April 7, 2007, alongside harpist Carol Robbins, Moore played several original songs at a local art building. After months of releasing demos via Myspace, Moore played on the Team Sleep Tour with a full band. The tour also featured supporting acts Monster in the Machine and Strata. Moore made several demo CDs available on this tour, limited to about 30 per show. These CDs were tour exclusive, and were packaged in \"baby blue envelopes\", each with a unique drawing by Moore or bandmate. In February 2008, Alternative Press Magazine announced the second annual AP Tour, with All Time Low, The Rocket Summer, The Matches, and Forever the Sickest Kids, as well as Sonny Moore. The tour started in Houston, Texas on March 14 and went through North America, ending in Cleveland, Ohio on May 2, with the majority of the shows being sold out. All bands playing the tour would be featured on the cover of Alternative Press Magazine's annual 100 Bands You Need to Know special, and would be interviewed on the Alternative Press Podcast. During this tour Moore's line-up consisted of Sean Friday on drums, Christopher Null on guitar, and Aaron Rothe on keyboards. On April 7, 2009, he released Gypsyhook EP, a digital EP, which featured three songs and four remixes. Also included was a Japanese version of \"Mora\" entitled \"Êµ∑Ê∞¥\" (\"Kaisui\"). Physical copies of the EP were available at his shows. After going on tour with Innerpartysystem and Paper Route and opening for Chiodos on their European tour, Moore performed at Bamboozle on May 2. He performed on Bamboozle Left's Saints and Sinners stage on April 4. He toured with Hollywood Undead in April 2009 performing under the band name Sonny and the Blood Monkeys, with Chris Null (electric guitar), Sean Friday (drums, percussion & beats) and Aaron Rothe (keyboards, synthesizers, programming & turntables) Although no official statement has been given regarding the album, Moore has stated that Bells will no longer be released. \n\nProduction career:\n\nIn 2008, Moore began producing and performing under the alias Skrillex at clubs in the Los Angeles area. Previously, he had been known on the Internet as Twipz. On June 7, 2010, Moore released his official Skrillex debut EP, My Name is Skrillex as a free download. Moore provided programming and vocals for UK metalcore band Bring Me the Horizon on their third studio album, There Is a Hell, Believe Me I've Seen It. There Is a Heaven, Let's Keep It a Secret. Later in the year, Sonny began a nationwide tour with Deadmau5 after being signed to mau5trap recordings and released his second EP, Scary Monsters and Nice Sprites. Moore kicked off the \"Project Blue Book Tour\" in 2011 with support from Porter Robinson, Tommy Lee and DJ Aero as well as appearances from Sofia Toufa for a new song titled \"Bring out the Devil.\" Skrillex unveiled several new songs on this tour including \"First Of The Year\" (formerly known as \"Equinox\"), \"Reptile\", and \"Cinema\" (remix of a Benny Benassi track). \"Reptile\" was featured in the TV commercial for Mortal Kombat 9, and \"First of the Year (Equinox)\" is featured on his follow up EP and remix companion to Scary Monsters and Nice Sprites, titled More Monsters and Sprites. In April 2011, Spin magazine premiered \"Get Up\", an exclusive new track from Korn that was produced by Skrillex. Korn made \"Get Up\" available for free download via their Facebook page. On April 15, 2011 KoRn joined Skrillex on stage for his set at Coachella 2011. On April 18, 2011, Sony Computer Entertainment (SCEA) development studio Naughty Dog released a trailer for the multiplayer component of their PlayStation 3 game Uncharted 3: Drake's Deception, featuring \"Kill EVERYBODY\" from Scary Monsters and Nice Sprites. In June 2011, \"More Monsters and Sprites\" was released on Beatport, an EP consisting of three original tracks, including \"First of the Year (Equinox)\" and two versions of his original track \"Ruffneck\". A leaked track entitled \"Ruffneck Bass\" had been leaked on the internet months prior which used the same sample as in the new \"Ruffneck\" tracks on the EP. Skrillex released a music video for \"Rock n' Roll (Will Take You to the Mountain)\" on his official YouTube page on June 20, 2011. \n\nOn August 17, 2011 Skrillex announced his label, OWSLA. \"The label's first releases will come from Bristol-based dubstep producer Koan Sound, electro-house newcomer Porter Robinson from North Carolina, singer/songwriter Alvin Risk, and San Francisco-based M Machine (formally Metropolis).\" Skrillex released a music video for \"First of the Year (Equinox)\" via Spin.com on August 19, 2011. In late August 2011 it was released that he would be appearing Knife Party's first release, collaborating on a Moombahton style track entitled \"Zoology\". A preview was released on YouTube. In late September 2011 he created the track \"Syndicate\" as promotion for the video game of the same name. Kaskade's 2011 album Fire & Ice features a collaboration between Kaskade and Skrillex entitled \"Lick It\". The video for Skrillex's song \"First of the Year (Equinox)\" appears on the first episode of the Beavis and Butt-head revival. On November 8, Skrillex stated that he intended to release an album entitled Voltage. Skrillex gave fans more info about Voltage in RockSound Magazine after a photoshoot for the cover and doing an extensive interview on his tour. For unknown reasons, however, the album was never released. On December 21, 2011, Skrillex unveiled the Bangarang EP for a Beatport release on December 23. On March 13, 2012, Beatport released OWSLA's second Free Treats sampler, Free Treats Vol. 2. The 19-track compilation features \"Ruffneck (FULL Flex) Munchi Anonymous Revolution Remix\", a remixed track by Skrillex. This new take on the track deviates from the original (released on the More Monsters and Sprites EP), with the remix being more characteristic of Electro House, though with a much slower tempo of 108 BPM, versus the original version's classic Dubstep tempo of 140 BPM, also straying from the typical Electro House tempo of 128 BPM. On August 12, 2012, his new side-project formed with Boys Noize called Dog Blood released an EP called Next Order/Middle Finger. \n\nInfluences:\nMoore has stated in an online interview that he has been a longtime fan of Warp, an electronic music label that has released recordings from artists such as Aphex Twin and Squarepusher. \n\nPersonal life:\nAs of February 2012, Skrillex has been dating fellow artist and singer, Ellie Goulding, who provided vocals for the Skrillex track, \"Summit\", featured on the EP, Bangarang.",

The band consists of lead vocalist and guitarist Billie Joe Armstrong, bassist and backing vocalist Mike Dirnt, and drummer Tre Cool. Cool replaced former drummer John Kiffmeyer in 1990, prior to the recording of the band's second studio album, Kerplunk (1992). Green Day was originally part of the punk scene at 924 Gilman Street in Berkeley, California. The band's early releases were from the independent record label Lookout! Records. In 1994, its major label debut Dookie released through Reprise Records became a breakout success and eventually sold over 10 million copies in the U.S. Green Day was widely credited, alongside fellow California punk bands Sublime,The Offspring and Rancid, with popularizing and reviving mainstream interest in punk rock in the United States. Green Day's three follow-up albums, Insomniac (1995), Nimrod (1997), and Warning (2000) did not achieve the massive success of Dookie, though they were still successful, with Insomniac and Nimrod reaching double platinum and Warning reaching gold status. The band's rock opera, American Idiot (2004), reignited the band's popularity with a younger generation, selling five million copies in the United States. The band's eighth studio album, 21st Century Breakdown, was released in 2009 which achieved the band's best chart performance to date. The band will begin to release a trilogy of albums called ¬°Uno!, ¬°Dos!, and ¬°Tr√©!, to be released September 25, 2012, November 13, 2012, and January 15, 2013 respectively. Green Day has sold over 65 million records worldwide with 25 million in the US alone. The group has won five Grammy Awards: Best Alternative Album for Dookie, Best Rock Album for American Idiot, Record of the Year for \"Boulevard of Broken Dreams\", Best Rock Album for the second time for 21st Century Breakdown and Best Musical Show Album for American Idiot: The Original Broadway Cast Recording. In 2010, a stage adaptation of American Idiot debuted on Broadway. The musical was nominated for several Tony Awards, including Best Musical and Best Scenic Design. \n\nHistory:\n\nFormation and Lookout! years (1987-1993):\nIn 1987, friends Billie Joe Armstrong and Mike Dirnt, 15 years old at the time, formed a band called Sweet Children. Its first live performance took place on October 17, 1987 at Rod's Hickory Pit in Vallejo, California. In 1988, Armstrong and Dirnt began working with Sean Hughes and the former Isocracy drummer John Kiffmeyer, also known as \"Al Sobrante\". As said in the film Punk's Not Dead, Armstrong cites the band Operation Ivy (which featured Tim Armstrong and Matt Freeman of Rancid) as a major influence, and a group that inspired him to form a band. In 1988, Larry Livermore, owner of Lookout! Records, saw the band play an early show and signed the group to his label. In 1989, the band recorded its debut extended play, 1,000 Hours. Before 1,000 Hours was released, the group dropped the name Sweet Children; according to Livermore, this was done to avoid confusion with another local band Sweet Baby. The band adopted the name Green Day, due to their fondness for marijuana. Lookout! would release Green Day's debut studio album, 39/Smooth in early 1990. Green Day would record two extended plays later that year, Slappy and Sweet Children, the latter of which included older songs that the band had recorded for the Minneapolis independent record label Skene! Records. In 1991, Lookout! Records re-released 39/Smooth under the name 1,039/Smoothed Out Slappy Hours, and added the songs from the band's first two EPs, Slappy, and 1,000 Hours. In late 1990, shortly after the band's first nationwide tour, Sobrante left the East Bay area to attend college.The Lookouts drummer Tre Cool began filling in as a temporary replacement and later Cool's position as Green Day's drummer became permanent. The band went on tour for most of 1992 and 1993, and played a number of shows overseas in Europe. The band's second studio album Kerplunk sold 50,000 copies in the U.S. \n\nBreakthrough success (1994-1996):\n\nKerplunk's underground success led to a number of major record labels being interested in signing Green Day, and the band eventually left Lookout! and signed to Reprise Records after attracting the attention of producer Rob Cavallo. The group was impressed by his work with fellow Californian band The Muffs, and later remarked that Cavallo \"was the only person we could really talk to and connect with\". Reflecting on the period, Armstrong told Spin magazine in 1999, \"I couldn't go back to the punk scene, whether we were the biggest success in the world or the biggest failure ... The only thing I could do was get on my bike and go forward.\" After signing with Reprise, the band went to work on recording its major label debut, Dookie. Recorded in three weeks, and released in February 1994,Dookie became a commercial success, helped by extensive MTV airplay for the videos of the songs \"Longview\", \"Basket Case\", and \"When I Come Around\", all of which reached the number one position on the Modern Rock Tracks charts. That year, Green Day embarked on a nationwide tour with queercore band Pansy Division as its opening act. At a September 9, 1994 performance at Hatch Memorial Shell in Boston, mayhem broke-out during the band's set (cut short to seven songs) and by the end of the rampage, 100 people were injured and 45 arrested. The band also joined the lineups of both the Lollapalooza festival and Woodstock '94, where they started an infamous mud fight. During the concert, a security guard mistook bassist Mike Dirnt for a stage-invading fan and punched out some of his teeth. Viewed by millions by pay-per-view television, the Woodstock 1994 performance further aided Green Day's growing publicity and recognition, and helped push its album to eventual diamond status. In 1995, Dookie won the Grammy Award for Best Alternative Album and the band was nominated for nine MTV Video Music Awards including Video of the Year. In 1995, a new single for the Angus soundtrack was released, entitled \"J.A.R.\". The single debuted at number one on the Billboard Modern Rock Tracks chart. The song was followed by the band's fourth studio album, Insomniac, which was released in the fall of 1995. Insomniac was a much darker and heavier response to the band's newfound popularity, compared to the more melodic Dookie. The album opened to a warm critical reception, earning 4 out of 5 stars from Rolling Stone, which said \"In punk, the good stuff actually unfolds and gains meaning as you listen without sacrificing any of its electric, haywire immediacy. And Green Day are as good as this stuff gets.\" The singles released from Insomniac were \"Geek Stink Breath\", \"Stuck with Me\", \"Brain Stew/Jaded\", and \"Walking Contradiction\". Though the album did not approach the success of Dookie, it sold two million copies in the United States. In addition, the album won the band award nominations for Favorite Artist, Favorite Hard Rock Artist, and Favorite Alternative Artist at the 1996 American Music Awards, and the video for \"Walking Contradiction\" got the band a Grammy nomination for Best Video, Short Form, in addition to a Best Special Effects nomination at the MTV Video Music Awards. After that, the band abruptly cancelled a European tour, citing exhaustion. \n\nMiddle years and decline in commercial success (1997-2002):\nAfter a brief hiatus in 1996, Green Day began to work on a new album in 1997. From the outset, both the band and Cavallo agreed that the album had to be different from its previous albums. The result was Nimrod, an experimental deviation from the band's standard pop-punk brand of music. The new album was released in October 1997. It provided a variety of music, from pop-punk, surf rock, and ska, to an acoustic ballad. Nimrod entered the charts at number 10. The success of \"Good Riddance (Time of Your Life)\" won the band an MTV Video Award for Best Alternative Video. The song was also used in the second \"clip show\" episode of Seinfeld and on two episodes of ER. The other singles released from Nimrod were \"Nice Guys Finish Last\", \"Hitchin' a Ride\" and \"Redundant\". The band made a guest appearance in an episode of King of the Hill entitled \"The Man Who Shot Cane Skretteberg\", which aired in 1997. In late 1997 and most of 1998, Green Day embarked on a tour in support of Nimrod. In 2000, Green Day released its sixth studio album Warning. In support of the album, the band participated in the Warped Tour in 2000. The band also had an independent tour to support the album in 2001. Critics' reviews of the album were varied.Allmusic gave it 4.5/5 saying \"Warning may not be an innovative record per se, but it's tremendously satisfying.\"Rolling Stone was more critical, giving it 3/5, and saying \"Warning... invites the question: Who wants to listen to songs of faith, hope and social commentary from what used to be snot-core's biggest-selling band?\" Though it produced the hit \"Minority\" and a smaller hit with \"Warning\", some observers were coming to the conclusion that the band was losing relevance, and a decline in popularity followed. While all of Green Day's previous albums had reached a status of at least double platinum, Warning was only certified gold. At the 2001 California Music Awards, Green Day won all eight of the awards that it was nominated for. The group won the awards for Outstanding Album (Warning), Outstanding Punk Rock/Ska Album (Warning), Outstanding Group, Outstanding Male Vocalist, Outstanding Bassist, Outstanding Drummer, Outstanding Songwriter, and Outstanding Artist. The release of two compilation albums, International Superhits! and Shenanigans, followed Warning. International Superhits and its companion collection of music videos, International Supervideos!. Shenanigans contained some of the band's b-sides, including \"Espionage\", which was featured in the film Austin Powers: The Spy Who Shagged Me and was nominated for a Grammy Award for Best Rock Instrumental Performance. In the spring of 2002, Green Day co-headlined the Pop Disaster Tour with Blink-182 which was documented on the DVD Riding in Vans with Boys. \n\nAmerican Idiot and renewed success (2003-2006):\n\nIn the summer of 2003, the band went into a studio to write and record new material for a new album, tentatively titled Cigarettes and Valentines. After completing 20 tracks, the master recordings were stolen from the studio. Instead of re-recording the stolen tracks, the band decided to abandon the entire project and start over, considering the material to be unrepresentative of the band's best work. It was then revealed that a band called The Network was signed to Armstrong's record label Adeline Records with little fanfare and information. After the mysterious band released an album called Money Money 2020, it was rumored that The Network was a Green Day side project, due to the similarities in the bands' sounds. However, these rumors were never addressed by the band or Adeline Records, except for a statement on the Adeline website discussing an ongoing dispute between the two bands. Green Day collaborated with Iggy Pop on two tracks for his album Skull Ring in November 2003. On February 1, 2004 a new song, a cover of \"I Fought the Law\" made its debut on a commercial for iTunes during NFL Super Bowl XXXVIII. \n\nThe resulting album, American Idiot (2004), debuted at number one on the Billboard charts, the band's first album to reach number one, backed by the success of the album's first single, American Idiot. The album was labeled as a punk rock opera which follows the journey of the fictitious Jesus of Suburbia.American Idiot won the 2005 Grammy for Best Rock Album. The band also won a total of seven awards out of eight awards for which they were nominated, including the Viewer's Choice Award in MTV Video Music Awards 2005. Through 2005, the band toured in support of the album with nearly 150 dates (Longest tour in their career) visiting Japan, Australia, South America and the United Kingdom. While touring for American Idiot, they filmed and recorded the two concerts at the Milton Keynes National Bowl in England, which was voted 'The Best Show On Earth' in a Kerrang! Magazine Poll. These recordings were released as a live CD and DVD called Bullet in a Bible on November 15, 2005. This CD/DVD featured songs from American Idiot as well as songs from all its previous albums, except Kerplunk and 1,039/Smoothed Out Slappy Hours. The DVD featured behind-the-scenes footage of the band, and showed how the band prepared to put on the show. The final shows of its 2005 world tour were in Sydney and Melbourne in Australia, on December 14 and 17 respectively. On August 1, 2005, Green Day announced that it had rescinded the master rights to its pre-Dookie material from Lookout! Records, citing a continuing breach of contract regarding unpaid royalties, a complaint shared with other Lookout! bands. On January 10, 2006 the band was awarded with a People's Choice Award as favorite musical group or band. \n\n21st Century Breakdown and American Idiot: The Musical (2006-2010):\nGreen Day engaged in a number of other smaller projects in the time following the success of American Idiot. The group released an album under the name Foxboro Hot Tubs entitled Stop Drop and Roll!!!. In 2008, the Foxboro Hot Tubs went on a mini-tour to promote the record, hitting tiny Bay Area venues including the Stork Club in Oakland and Toot's Tavern in Crockett, CA. \n\nIn an interview with Carson Daly, Garbage lead singer Shirley Manson revealed that Butch Vig would be producing Green Day's forthcoming album. The span of nearly five years between American Idiot and 21st Century Breakdown was the longest gap between studio albums in Green Day's career. The band had been working on new material since January 2006. By October 2007, Armstrong had 45 songs written, but the band showed no further signs of progress until October 2008, when two videos showing the band recording in the studio with producer Butch Vig were posted on YouTube. The writing and recording process, spanning three years and four recording studios, was finally finished in April 2009. 21st Century Breakdown, was released on May 15, 2009. The album received a mainly positive reception from critics, getting an average rating between 3 and 4 stars. After the release, the album reached number one in fourteen countries, being certified gold or platinum in each. 21st Century Breakdown achieved Green Day's best chart performance to date. The band started playing shows in California in April and early May. It was their first live show in about three years. Green Day went on a world tour that started in North America in July 2009 and continuing around the world throughout the rest of 2009 and early 2010.Wal-Mart refused to carry the album as it contains a Parental Advisory sticker and requested that Green Day release a censored edition. The band members did not wish to change any lyrics on the album and responded by stating, \"There's nothing dirty about our record... They want artists to censor their records in order to be carried in there. We just said no. We've never done it before. You feel like you're in 1953 or something.\" In 2009, the band met with award-winning director Michael Mayer and many cast and crew members of the Tony Award-winning musical Spring Awakening to create a stage version of the album American Idiot.American Idiot: The Musical opened in the Berkeley Repertory Theatre during the end of 2009. The show features an expanded story of the original album, with new characters such as Will, Extraordinary Girl, and Favorite Son. On April 20, 2010, American Idiot: The Musical opened on Broadway, and Green Day released the soundtrack to the musical, featuring a new song by Green Day entitled \"When It's Time\". In June 2010 the iTunes received the single \"When It's Time\". During the Spike TV Video Game Awards 2009, it was announced that Green Day was set to have its own Rock Band video game titled as Green Day: Rock Band, as a follow-up to the last band specific Rock Band game, The Beatles: Rock Band. The game features the full albums of Dookie, American Idiot, and 21st Century Breakdown as well as select songs from the rest of Green Day's discography. During the second leg of the 21st Century Breakdown World Tour the band had said that they are writing new material. In an interview with Kerrang! magazine, Armstrong spoke about the possible new album: \"We did some demos in Berlin, some in Stockholm, some just outside of Glasgow and some in Amsterdam. We wanted get the songs down in some early form.\" The band also stated that they were recording a live album during the entire tour on the last date of the tour in Mountain View, California, also before playing the song \"Cigarettes and Valentines\". In October 2010, Dirnt was interviewed by Radio W, mentioning that they have completed the writing process of the ninth studio album. In the interview, Dirnt also mentioned that a new live album will \"most likely\" be released. The live CD/DVD and CD/Blu-ray entitled Awesome as Fuck was released on March 22, 2011. \n\n¬°Uno!, ¬°Dos!, and ¬°Tr√©! (2011-present):\nOn August 11, 2011, Green Day played a secret show in Costa Mesa, California, and performed an entire set of over 15 new songs allegedly for a possible upcoming album. Green Day put a news post on their official website which read \"Thanks everyone for coming out to the show...\" and \"Stay tuned for more\". It also included lyrics to a new song that was played at the show called \"Amy\" which is dedicated to Amy Winehouse, who died weeks before the show. In February 2012, Armstrong announced through Twitter that the band were in the studio, recording material for a new album. On February 24, 2012, the band began uploading behind the scenes videos of the recording of the new album to YouTube. On April 11, singer Billie Joe Armstrong announced that Green Day would be releasing a trilogy of albums called ¬°Uno!, ¬°Dos!, and ¬°Tr√©!. Armstrong stated that they would be released on September 25, 2012, November 13, 2012, and January 15, 2013 respectively. On June 14, 2012, Green Day released the official artwork of the album ¬°Uno! on YouTube and Facebook. Armstrong in a talk with Rolling Stone Magazine confirmed that each album will have a member of the band on its cover. The ¬°Uno! ¬°Dos! ¬°Tr√©! Ultimate Box Set has also been announced by Warner Bros. Records and will contain all three albums, as well as various other content, such as three digital singles and a one year online membership or renewal to the Idiot Club. The band played at the Rock En Seine festival in France on August 24-26, 2012, the Rock am See festival in Germany on September 1, 2012 and the Reading festival in the UK. The band has also announced a US tour supporting the trilogy, from November 2012 through February 2013. ¬°Uno! was released on September 24, 2012 and has been met with generally favorable reviews. \n\nMusical style and influences:\n\nGreen Day's sound is often compared to first wave punk bands such as the Ramones, The Clash, Sex Pistols, and the Buzzcocks. Citing the band's musical style prevalent on Dookie, Stephen Erlewine of Allmusic described Green Day as \"punk revivalists who recharged the energy of speedy, catchy three-chord punk-pop songs.\" While Armstrong is the primary songwriter, he looks to the other band members for organizational help. Billie Joe Armstrong has mentioned that some of his biggest influences are seminal alternative rock bands H√ºsker D√º and The Replacements, and that their influence is particularly noted in the band's chord changes in songs. Green Day has covered H√ºsker D√º's \"Don't Want to Know If You Are Lonely\" as a b-side to the \"Warning\" single, and the character \"Mr. Whirly\" in their song \"Misery\" is a reference to the Replacements song of the same name. Among other influences, Green Day have also cited The Who and power pop pioneers Cheap Trick. The band has generated controversy over whether the band's musical style and major-label status constitutes as \"true punk\". In reaction to both the style of music and the background of the band, John Lydon, former front man of the 1970s punk band the Sex Pistols commented: \n\"So there we are fending off all that and it pisses me off that years later a wank outfit like Green Day hop in and nick all that and attach it to themselves. They didn't earn their wings to do that and if they were true punk they wouldn't look anything like they do.\" \nArmstrong himself has discussed the group's status of being a punk band on a major record label, saying \"Sometimes I think we've become totally redundant because we're this big band now, we've made a lot of money - we're not punk rock any more. But then I think about it and just say, 'You can take us out of a punk rock environment, but you can't take the punk rock out of us.'\" English rock musician Noel Gallagher of Oasis also complained about the band semi-jokingly, claiming that they ripped off his song \"Wonderwall\" with their song \"Boulevard of Broken Dreams\". \n\nRelated projects:\nSince 1991, members of the band have branched out past Green Day and have started other projects with other musicians. Notable related projects of Green Day include Billie Joe Armstrong's Pinhead Gunpowder (which also features Green Day's live back-up guitarist Jason White), The Frustrators in which Mike Dirnt plays bass, and The Network, a collaboration between Green Day and members of the band, Devo in which all members play under fake stage names. Green Day has also released an album titled Stop Drop and Roll!!! on May 20, 2008, under the name Foxboro Hot Tubs, they currently use this name to book secret shows. In late December 2011, Armstrong formed a new side band called The Boo along his wife Adrienne and their two sons. In September 2006, Green Day collaborated with U2 and producer Rick Rubin to record a cover of the song \"The Saints Are Coming\", originally recorded by The Skids, with an accompanying video. The song was recorded to benefit Music Rising, an organization to help raise money for musicians' instruments lost during Hurricane Katrina, and to bring awareness on the eve of the one year anniversary of the disaster. In December 2006, Green Day and NRDC opened a web site in partnership to raise awareness on America's dependency on oil. Green Day released a cover of the John Lennon song \"Working Class Hero\", which was featured on the album Instant Karma: The Amnesty International Campaign to Save Darfur. The band performed the song on the season finale of American Idol. The song was nominated for a Grammy Award in 2008, though lost to The White Stripes' \"Icky Thump\". That summer, the band appeared in a cameo role in The Simpsons Movie, where they perform the show's theme song. Their version was released as a single on July 24, 2007. In 2009, the band collaborated with theatre director Michael Mayer to adapt their rock opera American Idiot into a one-act stage musical that premiered at the Berkeley Rep on September 15, 2009. The show then moved to Broadway on April 20, 2010. The reviews of American Idiot: The Musical have been positive to mixed. Charles Isherwood of The New York Times wrote an enthusiastic review for the Broadway production. He called the show \"a pulsating portrait of wasted youth that invokes all the standard genre conventions ... only to transcend them through the power of its music and the artistry of its execution, the show is as invigorating and ultimately as moving as anything I've seen on Broadway this season. Or maybe for a few seasons past.\" Jed Gottlieb of the Boston Herald enjoyed the premise of the show but found that \"the music and message suffer in a setting where the audience is politely, soberly seated\". Michael Kuchiwara of the Associated Press found the show to be \"visually striking and musically adventurous\", but noted that \"the show has the barest wisp of a story and minimal character development\". Paul Kolnik in USA Today enjoyed the contradiction that Green Day's \"massively popular, starkly disenchanted album ... would be the feel-good musical of the season\". Time magazine's Richard Zoglin opined that the score \"is as pure a specimen of contemporary punk rock as Broadway has yet encountered yet there's enough variety. ... Where the show fall short is as a fully developed narrative.\" He concluded that \"American Idiot, despite its earnest huffing and puffing, remains little more than an annotated rock concert. ... Still, it deserves at least two cheers - for its irresistible musical energy and for opening fresh vistas for that odd couple, rock and Broadway.\" Peter Travers from Rolling Stone, in his review of American Idiot, wrote \"Though American Idiot carries echoes of such rock musicals as Tommy, Hair, Rent and Spring Awakening, it cuts its own path to the heart. You won't know what hit you. American Idiot knows no limits--it's a global knockout.\" The musical has been nominated for a number of Tony Awards, including Best Musical and Best Scenic Design. It was also nominated for a number of Drama Desk Awards and Outer Critics Circle Awards. In October 2009, a Green Day art project was exhibited at StolenSpace Gallery in London. The exhibition showed artworks created for each of the songs on 21st Century Breakdown, was supported by the band, and led by their manager Pat Magnarella. He explained in an interview that \"Artists are basically like rock bands. Most are creating their art, but don't know how to promote it.\" For Billie Joe Armstrong, \"Many of the artists... show their work on the street, and we feel a strong connection to that type of creative expression.\" On April 13, 2011, a film version of American Idiot was confirmed. Michael Mayer, director of the Broadway musical, will be directing the film. It will be produced by Green Day, Pat Magnarella (Green Day's manager who also produced Bullet in a Bible, Awesome as Fuck, and Heart Like a Hand Grenade), Playtone (Tom Hanks and Gary Goetzman) and Tom Hulce. \n\nInvolvement in politics and social justice:\nWhen asked his opinion regarding whether all musicians ought to try to add a social or political message to their work, Armstrong replied that \" \nThe only people who should sing about social issues or politics are the ones who aren't full of shit. \n\" \n American Idiot was released two months before former President of the United States George W. Bush was reelected, and as a result the album became protest art. Created as an anti-war album, American Idiot contains many new-age protest songs, like Holiday which was against George Bush's decision to invade Iraq. Armstrong described the song as a means by which \"to battle your way out of your own ignorance\". \n\nBand members:\n\nCurrent members \nBillie Joe Armstrong - lead vocals, guitar, piano, harmonica (1987-present), \nMike Dirnt - bass, backing vocals (1988-present), rhythm guitar (1987-1988), \nTr√© Cool - drums, percussion, backing vocals (1990-present), \nSession and touring members \nJason White - lead and rhythm guitars, backing vocals (1999-present), \nJason Freese - keyboards, piano, saxophone, trombone, backing vocals (2003-present), \nJeff Matika - rhythm guitar, acoustic guitar, backing vocals (2009-present), \n\nFormer members \nJohn Kiffmeyer - drums, percussion (1987-1990), \nSean Hughes - bass (1987-1988), \nFormer touring members \nTimmy Chunks - guitars (1997-1999), \nGarth Schultz - trombone, trumpet (1997-1999), \nGabrial McNair - trombone, tenor saxophone (1999-2001), \nJeanne Geiger - trombone (2001), \nKurt Lohmiller - trumpet, timpani, percussion, backing vocals (1999-2004), \nMike Pelino - rhythm guitar, backing vocals (2004-2005), \nRonnie Blake - trumpet, timpani, percussion, backing vocals (2004-2005)",

The band has consisted of Billie Joe Armstrong (vocals, guitar), Mike Dirnt (bass guitar, vocals), and Tr√© Cool (drums, percussion) for the majority of its existence.  Green Day was originally part of the punk rock scene at 924 Gilman Street, Berkeley in  East Bay, CA, United States . Its early releases for independent record label Lookout! Records earned them a grassroots fanbase, some of whom felt alienated when the band signed to a major label. Nevertheless, its major label debut Dookie (1994) became a breakout success and eventually sold over 10 million copies in the US. and 15 million worldwide. As a result, Green Day was widely credited, alongside fellow California punk bands The Offspring and Rancid, with reviving mainstream interest in and popularizing punk rock in the United States. Green Day's three follow-up albums, Insomniac, Nimrod and Warning did not achieve the massive success of Dookie, but they were still successful, reaching double platinum, double platinum, and gold status respectively. Green Day's 2004 rock opera American Idiot reignited the band's popularity with a younger generation, selling five million copies in the U.S.The band's eighth studio album, 21st Century Breakdown, was released on May 15, 2009.  Green Day has sold over 22 million records in the United States.They have won three Grammy Awards; Best Alternative Album for Dookie, Best Rock Album for American Idiot, and Record of the Year for Boulevard of Broken Dreams.  In 1987, friends Billie Joe Armstrong and Mike Dirnt, 15 years old at the time, formed a band called Sweet Children. The first Sweet Children show took place on October 17, 1987, at Rod's Hickory Pit in Vallejo, California where Armstrong's mother was working.In 1988, Armstrong and Dirnt began working with former Isocracy drummer, John Kiffmeyer (also known as Al Sobrante). Kiffmeyer served as both the band's drummer and business manager, handling the booking of shows and helping the band establish a fan base.  Larry Livermore, owner of Lookout! Records, saw the band play an early show and signed them to his label. In 1989 they recorded their first EP, 1,000 Hours. Before 1,000 Hours was released, the band dropped the name Sweet Children, according to Livermore this was done in order to avoid confusion with another local band Sweet Baby.The band adopted the name Green Day, allegedly due to their fondness of marijuana.  Lookout! would release Green Day's first LP, 39/Smooth in early 1990. Green Day would record two EPs later that year: Slappy and Sweet Children, the latter of which included some older songs they had recorded for Minneapolis indie label Skene! Records. In 1991, Lookout! Records released 1,039/Smoothed Out Slappy Hours, a compilation of the 39/Smooth, Slappy, and 1,000 Hours EPs. In late 1990, shortly after the band's first nationwide tour, Sobrante left the East Bay area to attend college. The Lookouts drummer Tr√© Cool began filling in as a temporary replacement, and when it became clear that Sobrante did not plan on committing to the band full time, Tr√© Cool's position as Green Day's drummer became permanent. The band went on tour for most of 1992 and 1993, and played a stretch of shows overseas in Europe. The band's second full length album Kerplunk sold about 50,000 copies in the U.S., which was considered quite a large amount for the independent punk scene in 1992.  Kerplunk's underground success led to a wave of interest coming from major record labels, and eventually they left Lookout! on friendly terms and signed with Reprise Records after attracting the attention of producer Rob Cavallo. Signing to Reprise caused many punk rock fans to regard Green Day as sellouts.Reflecting on the period, Armstrong told SPIN magazine in 1999, \"I couldn't go back to the punk scene, whether we were the biggest success in the world or the biggest failure ... The only thing I could do was get on my bike and go forward.\" After signing with Reprise, the band went to work on recording its major label debut, Dookie.  \"Longview\" Play sound Sample of \"Longview\", the first single from Dookie, which combined a memorable bass line with a guitar riff and drums introduced in the chorus.

Problems listening to this file? See media help.  Released in February 1994, and recorded in 3 weeks,Dookie became a commercial success, helped by extensive MTV airplay for the videos of the songs \"Longview\", \"Basket Case\", and \"When I Come Around\", all of which reached the number one position on the Modern Rock Tracks charts. That year, Green Day embarked on a nationwide tour with queercore band Pansy Division as its opening act. At a September 9, 1994 concert at Boston Esplanade, mayhem broke-out during the band's set (cut short to seven songs) and by the end of the rampage, 100 people were injured and 45 arrested. The band also joined the lineups of both the Lollapalooza festival and Woodstock 1994, where they started an infamous mud fight. During the concert, a security guard mistook bassist Mike Dirnt for a stage-invading fan and punched out some of his teeth. Viewed by millions via pay-per-view television, the Woodstock 1994 performance further aided Green Day's growing publicity and recognition, and helped push its album to eventual diamond status. In 1995, Dookie won the Grammy Award for Best Alternative Album and the band was nominated for 9 MTV Video Music Awards including Video of the Year. The full fold-out artwork to Insomniac, entitled God Told Me to Skin You Alive.  In 1995, a new single for the Angus soundtrack was released, titled \"J.A.R.\". The single went straight to number one on the Billboard Modern Rock Tracks chart. The song was followed by the band's new album, Insomniac, which was released in the fall of 1995. Insomniac was a much darker and heavier response by the band, compared to the poppier, more melodic Dookie. Insomniac opened to a warm critical reception, earning 4 out of 5 stars from Rolling Stone, which said \"In punk, the good stuff actually unfolds and gains meaning as you listen without sacrificing any of its electric, haywire immediacy. And Green Day are as good as this stuff gets.\"Insomniac used a piece of art by Winston Smith entitled God Told Me to Skin You Alive for its album cover. The singles released from Insomniac were \"Geek Stink Breath\", \"Brain Stew/Jaded\", \"Walking Contradiction\", and \"Stuck With Me\". Though the album did not approach the success of Dookie, it still sold two million copies in the United States.Insomniac won the band award nominations for Favorite Artist, Favorite Hard Rock Artist, and Favorite Alternative Artist at the 1996 American Music Awards, and the video for \"Walking Contradiction\" got the band a Grammy nomination for Best Video, Short Form, in addition to a Best Special Effects nomination at the MTV Video Music Awards.[20] After that, the band abruptly cancelled a European tour, citing exhaustion.  Middle era: 1997-2002  After taking a break in 1996, Green Day began to work on a new album in 1997. From the outset, both the band and Cavallo agreed that the album had to be different from its previous records.The result was Nimrod, an experimental deviation from the band's standard pop-punk brand of music. The new album was released in October 1997. It provided a variety of music, from pop-punk, surf rock, and ska, to an acoustic ballad. Nimrod entered the charts at number 10. The success of \"Good Riddance (Time of Your Life)\" won the band an MTV Video Award for Best Alternative Video for the song's video, which depicted people undergoing major changes in their lives while Billie Joe Armstrong strummed his acoustic guitar. The song was also used in the second \"clip show\" episode of Seinfeld and on two episodes of ER. The other singles released from Nimrod were \"Nice Guys Finish Last\", \"Hitchin' a Ride\" and \"Redundant\". The band made a guest appearance in an episode of King of the Hill entitled \"The Man Who Shot Cane Skretteberg\", which aired in 1997.  In 2000, Green Day released Warning, a step further in the style that they had hinted at with Nimrod. Critics' reviews of the album were varied.Allmusic gave it 4.5/5 saying \"Warning may not be an innovative record per se, but it's tremendously satisfying.\" Rolling Stone was more critical, giving it 3/5, and saying \"Warning... invites the question: Who wants to listen to songs of faith, hope and social commentary from what used to be snot-core's biggest-selling band?\" Though it produced the hit \"Minority\" and a smaller hit with \"Warning\", some observers were coming to the conclusion that the band was losing relevance,and a decline in popularity followed. While all of Green Day's past albums had reached a status of at least double platinum, Warning was only certified gold.  At the 2001 California Music Awards, Green Day won all eight awards that they were nominated for. They won the awards for Outstanding Album (Warning), Outstanding Punk Rock/Ska Album (Warning), Outstanding Group, Outstanding Male Vocalist, Outstanding Bassist, Outstanding Drummer, Outstanding Songwriter and Outstanding Artist  The release of a Greatest Hits compilation, International Superhits!, and an assemblage of B-sides, Shenanigans, followed Warning. International Superhits and its companion collection of music videos, International Supervideos!, sold reasonably well, going platinum in the U.S. Shenanigans contained some of the band's b-sides, including \"Espionage\" which was featured in Austin Powers: The Spy Who Shagged Me and was nominated for a Grammy for Best Rock Instrumental Performance.  In the spring of 2002, Green Day co-headlined the Pop Disaster Tour with Blink-182. Despite the co-headlining title, Green Day would play each show before Blink-182, who at the time were experiencing more success. The tour was documented on the DVD Riding In Vans With Boys.  American Idiot and renewed popularity: 2003-2006 Spectators watch Green Day from the grass slopes at the National Bowl.  In the summer of 2003 the band went into a studio to write and record new material for a new album, tentatively titled Cigarettes and Valentines. After completing 20 tracks, the master tapes were stolen from the studio. The band chose not to try to re-create the stolen album, but instead started over. By the end of 2003, Green Day collaborated with Iggy Pop on two tracks for his album Skull Ring. On February 1, 2004 a new song, a cover of \"I Fought the Law\" made its debut on a commercial for iTunes during NFL Super Bowl XXXVIII. The band underwent serious \"band therapy,\" engaging in several long talks to work out the members' differences after accusations from Dirnt and Cool that Armstrong was \"the band's Nazi\" and a show-off bent on taking the limelight from the other band members.  The resulting 2004 album, American Idiot, debuted at number one on the Billboard charts, the band's first ever album to top the chart, backed by the success of the album's first single, \"American Idiot.\" The album was billed as a \"punk rock opera\" which follows the journey of the fictitious \"Jesus of Suburbia\". American Idiot won the 2005 Grammy for \"Best Rock Album\" and the band swept the 2005 MTV music awards, winning a total of seven of the eight awards they were nominated for, including the coveted Viewer's Choice Award.  Through 2005, the band toured in support of the album with about 150 dates -- the longest tour in its career -- visiting Japan, Australia, South America and the United Kingdom, where they drew a crowd of 130,000 people over a span of two days. While touring for American Idiot, they filmed and recorded the two concerts at the Milton Keynes National Bowl in England, which was voted 'The Best Show On Earth' in a Kerrang! Magazine Poll.  These recordings were released as a live CD and DVD called Bullet in a Bible on November 15, 2005. This CD/DVD featured hits from American Idiot as well as a few songs from all its previous albums, except \"Kerplunk\" and \"1,039/Smoothed Out Slappy Hours\". The DVD featured behind-the-scenes footage of the band, and showed how the band prepared to put on the show. The final shows of its 2005 world tour were in Sydney, Australia, and Melbourne, Australia, on December 14 and 17 respectively. On January 10, 2006 the band was awarded with a People's Choice Award for favorite group. Green Day live in Germany during the American Idiot tour.  On August 1, 2005, Green Day announced that that it had rescinded the master rights to its pre-Dookie material from Lookout! Records, citing a continuing breach of contract regarding unpaid royalties, a complaint shared with other Lookout! bands. The pre-Dookie material, which remained out of print for about a year, was reissued by the band's current label, Reprise, on January 9, 2007.  In 2006, Green Day won the Grammy Award for Record of the Year for \"Boulevard of Broken Dreams\" which spent 16 weeks at the number one position of Billboard's Modern Rock Tracks, a record it shared along with Red Hot Chili Peppers' \"Scar Tissue\" and Staind's \"It's Been Awhile,\" (the record has been since been beaten by Foo Fighters' 2007 hit \"The Pretender\" which reigned at the top spot for 18 weeks).  Foxboro Hot Tubs and 21st Century Breakdown: 2007 onward  Green Day engaged in several other smaller projects in the time following the hype of American Idiot. In the spring of 2007, Green Day recorded a cover of the John Lennon song \"Working Class Hero\", which appeared on a compilation album \"Instant Karma\", that benefitted victims in Darfur. In the summer of 2007, Green Day recorded a version of The Simpsons theme song for The Simpsons Movie, as well as having an appearance in the movie.  Green Day recently released a new album under the name Foxboro Hot Tubs entitled Stop Drop and Roll!!!. In an interview with Kerrang!, Billie Joe revealed that 2008 would \"be a fair estimate of the release date of their new untitled eighth studio album.\"In a recent interview with Carson Daly, Garbage lead singer Shirley Manson revealed that Butch Vig would be producing Green Day's forthcoming album. In October 2008 Green Day returned to the studios with Butch Vig, to start recording the new studio album. Two videos showing the band in the studio were posted on YouTube. In the tour section of the band's official website, the message \"World Tour coming soon!\" is shown.In the December 9 issue of Alternative Press, in-depth details about the new album were released. According to the interview, Green Day are recording in the same studio as they did for American Idiot, Ocean Way Recording in Hollywood, California. \"This album is more... religious\", and is influenced by Bob Dylan, Bruce Springsteen, and The Beatles, to name a few.Billie Joe Armstrong said when he was being interviewed for Kerrang!'s readers poll, that it will be more power pop than punk rock.The new album is titled 21st Century Breakdown and was released worldwide on May 15, 2009. Green Day will be going on a world tour starting with North America in July, 2009 until sometime in 2010. Singles from 21st Century Breakdown include Know Your Enemy and 21 Guns.  Musical style and influences  Green Day's sound is often compared to first wave punk bands such as the Ramones, The Clash, Sex Pistols, The Jam, and the Buzzcocks. The majority of their song catalog is composed of distorted guitar, fast, manic drums, and relatively high-treble bass. Most of their songs are fast-paced and under four minutes. Billie Joe Armstrong has mentioned that some of his biggest influences are seminal alternative rock bands H√ºsker D√º and The Replacements, and that their influence is particularly noted in the band's chord changes in songs. In fact, Green Day has covered H√ºsker D√º's \"Don't Want to Know If You Are Lonely\" as a b-side for the \"Warning\" single, and the character \"Mr. Whirly\" in their song \"Misery\" is a reference to the Replacements song of the same name. Among other influences, Green Day have also cited Queen,proto-punks The Who, and power pop pioneers Cheap Trick [46]. Armstrong's lyrics commonly describe alienation, (\"Jesus of Suburbia\", \"Boulevard of Broken Dreams\", \"Road to Acceptance\", \"Disappearing Boy\", \"Castaway\") hysteria (\"Basket Case\", \"Panic Song\"), girls (\"She\", \"80\" \"Only of You\",\"Maria\" \"She's a Rebel\"), growing up (\"Longview\" and \"Welcome to Paradise\"), and the effects of doing drugs (\"Geek Stink Breath\", \"Green Day\"). The Ramones had similar lyrical themes such as hysteria (\"Anxiety\", \"Psycho Therapy\"), alienation (\"Outsider\", \"Something To Believe In\"), girls (\"I Wanna Be Your Boyfriend\", \"Sheena Is a Punk Rocker\"), and drugs (\"Now I Wanna Sniff Some Glue\", \"Chinese Rocks\"). Green Day has covered Ramones songs several times, including recording \"Outsider\" for the tribute album We're a Happy Family, and performing \"Blitzkrieg Bop\" and \"Teenage Lobotomy\" when the Ramones were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2002.  Criticism and controversy  Beginning with the release of Dookie, and the subsequent explosion of MTV airplay it received, Green Day has received considerable criticism from those who see the punk genre as a social movement independent of corporate sponsorship. With the release of American Idiot and the subsequent draw of many new fans, much of this criticism has been revived.  One of the more contentious issues is genre labeling. In reaction to both the style of music and the background of the band, many fans and musicians have taken heavy objection to the usage of the term \"punk\" when applied to Green Day. This is evidenced by the following comments issued by John Lydon (Johnny Rotten), former front man of both the 1970s punk band the Sex Pistols and the 1980s post-punk, Public Image Ltd.: \" So there we are fending off all that and it pisses me off that years later a wank outfit like Green Day hop in and nick all that and attach it to themselves. They didn't earn their wings to do that and if they were true punk they wouldn't look anything like they do. \"  Brandon Flowers of The Killers went on record in 2007 claiming that Green Day's politically driven concept album American Idiot displays \"calculated Anti-Americanism.\" He explained that he has problems with the album content itself and also the fact that the band's recent live DVD, Bullet in a Bible, was filmed in England. The taping of the concert, featured on Bullet in a Bible, shows thousands of Europeans singing along to \"American Idiot.\" Stating that he felt Green Day's DVD is a bit of a stunt, he said, \"I just thought it was really cheap. To go to a place like England or Germany and sing that song - those kids aren't taking it the same way that he meant it. And he (Billie Joe Armstrong) knew it.\"  More recently, Oasis guitarist Noel Gallagher has accused the band of ripping off his song \"Wonderwall\" for \"Boulevard of Broken Dreams\".  Related projects Main article: Green Day related projects  Ever since 1991, some members of the band have branched out past Green Day and have started other projects with other musicians. Notable related projects of Green Day include Billie Joe Armstrong's Pinhead Gunpowder (which also features Green Day's live backup guitarist Jason White), The Frustrators in which Mike Dirnt plays bass, and The Network, in which all three members of Green Day play under fake stage names. Billie Joe Armstrong has also confirmed that the main members of Green Day are in the band Foxboro Hot Tubs. A Foxboro Hot Tubs album titled Stop Drop and Roll!!! was released on 2008-05-20.  Charity projects that the band have been involved with include the collaboration with U2 (\"The Saints Are Coming\") to help raise money for musical instruments lost in Hurricane Katrina, and teaming with the Natural Resources Defense Council for the \"Move America Beyond Oil\" campaign and other environmental concerns.  In September 2006, Green Day teamed up with U2 and producer Rick Rubin to record a cover of the song \"The Saints Are Coming\", originally recorded by The Skids, with an accompanying video. The song is to benefit Music Rising, an organization to help raise money for musicians' instruments lost during Hurricane Katrina, and to bring awareness on the eve of the one year anniversary of the disaster.  \"Working Class Hero\" Play sound \"Working Class Hero\", a cover of a John Lennon song, was released on the Instant Karma CD. Problems listening to this file? See media help.  In December 2006, Green Day and NRDC opened a web site in partnership to raise awareness on America's dependency on oil. (See related projects.)  Green Day released a cover of the John Lennon song \"Working Class Hero\", that was featured on the album Instant Karma: The Amnesty International Campaign to Save Darfur. The band performed the song on the season finale of American Idol. The song was nominated for a Grammy in 2008, but lost to The White Stripes' \"Icky Thump\".  That summer, the band appeared in a cameo role in The Simpsons Movie, where they perform the show's theme song. Their version was released as a single on July 24, 2007.

Raised in Northeast Los Angeles and in Northern California, Moore joined the American post-hardcore band From First to Last as the lead singer in 2004, and recorded two studio albums with the band (Dear Diary, My Teen Angst Has a Body Count, 2004, and Heroine, 2006) before leaving to pursue a solo career in 2007. He began his first tour as a solo artist in late 2007. After recruiting a new band lineup, Moore joined the Alternative Press Tour to support bands such as All Time Low and The Rocket Summer, and appeared on the cover of Alternative Press' annual \"100 Bands You Need to Know\" issue. After releasing the Gypsyhook EP in 2009, Moore was scheduled to record his debut studio album, Bells, with producer Noah Shain. However, he ceased production of the album and began performing under the name Skrillex. After releasing the My Name is Skrillex EP for free download on his official MySpace page, he released the Scary Monsters and Nice Sprites EP in late-2010 and More Monsters and Sprites EP in mid-2011. Both have since become moderate commercial successes. On November 30, 2011, he was nominated for a total of five Grammy Awards at the 54th Grammy Awards, including Best New Artist and won three: \"Best Dance/Electronica Album,\" \"Best Dance Recording,\" and \"Best Remixed Recording, Non-Classical\". On December 5, 2011, the BBC announced that he had been nominated for their Sound of 2012 poll. On December 12, 2011, he was also named MTV's Electronic Dance Music Artist of the Year. \n\nBiography:\n\nBackground:\nMoore was born in the Highland Park neighborhood of Northeast Los Angeles, but moved to the Forest Hill neighborhood of San Francisco at the age of two, where he attended elementary school. At the ages of nine and ten, Moore attended a local boarding school located in the Mojave Desert LV, but eventually moved back to Northern California. By the age of twelve, his family moved him back to his birthplace of Northeast L.A., where he enrolled in a private academy school specializing in arts, and was then later home schooled at the age of fourteen due to bullying. In 2004, he learned he was adopted and dropped out of the program when he was sixteen years old. While a young teenager in Los Angeles, Moore would attend punk gigs in Mexican American neighborhoods in East and South Los Angeles, and later on electro club raves in the downtown's Silver Lake and Echo Park neighborhoods. \n\nFrom First to Last (2004-07):\nIn 2004, Moore contacted Matt Good of From First to Last about playing guitar for the band on their debut album. After flying out to Georgia, Moore was heard singing by three studio producers, Derrick Thomas, Eric Dale, and McHale Butler, and was then made lead singer, with Good playing guitar. In June 2004, Epitaph Records released the band's first full-length record with their new bandmate, Dear Diary, My Teen Angst Has a Body Count. After performing on several successful tours, two being the Vans Warped Tour and Dead by Dawn tour, they began recording their second album, Heroine with producer Ross Robinson. The album was released in March 2006 on Epitaph. With high record sales once again, the band found themselves part of many successful tours, until Moore started suffering vocal problems, causing the band to resign from several tours. After going through a successful vocal surgical procedure, Moore informed the band he would be permanently resigning to work on a solo career. FFTL's last show performed with Moore was in their hometown of Orlando at The House of Blues while touring with Atreyu. \n\nSolo career (2007-present):\n\nMoore announced he had left From First to Last to pursue a solo career. He then launched a Myspace page displaying three demos (\"Signal\", \"Equinox\", and \"Glow Worm\"). This led to Moore's first performance since his leaving From First to Last. On April 7, 2007, alongside harpist Carol Robbins, Moore played several original songs at a local art building. After months of releasing demos via Myspace, Moore played on the Team Sleep Tour with a full band. The tour also featured supporting acts Monster in the Machine and Strata. Moore made several demo CDs available on this tour, limited to about 30 per show. These CDs were tour exclusive, and were packaged in \"baby blue envelopes\", each with a unique drawing by Moore or bandmate. In February 2008, Alternative Press Magazine announced the second annual AP Tour, with All Time Low, The Rocket Summer, The Matches, and Forever the Sickest Kids, as well as Sonny Moore. The tour started in Houston, Texas on March 14 and went through North America, ending in Cleveland, Ohio on May 2, with the majority of the shows being sold out. All bands playing the tour would be featured on the cover of Alternative Press Magazine's annual 100 Bands You Need to Know special, and would be interviewed on the Alternative Press Podcast. During this tour Moore's line-up consisted of Sean Friday on drums, Christopher Null on guitar, and Aaron Rothe on keyboards. On April 7, 2009, he released Gypsyhook EP, a digital EP, which featured three songs and four remixes. Also included was a Japanese version of \"Mora\" entitled \"Êµ∑Ê∞¥\" (\"Kaisui\"). Physical copies of the EP were available at his shows. After going on tour with Innerpartysystem and Paper Route and opening for Chiodos on their European tour, Moore performed at Bamboozle on May 2. He performed on Bamboozle Left's Saints and Sinners stage on April 4. He toured with Hollywood Undead in April 2009 performing under the band name Sonny and the Blood Monkeys, with Chris Null (electric guitar), Sean Friday (drums, percussion & beats) and Aaron Rothe (keyboards, synthesizers, programming & turntables) Although no official statement has been given regarding the album, Moore has stated that Bells will no longer be released. \n\nProduction career:\n\nIn 2008, Moore began producing and performing under the alias Skrillex at clubs in the Los Angeles area. Previously, he had been known on the Internet as Twipz. On June 7, 2010, Moore released his official Skrillex debut EP, My Name is Skrillex as a free download. Moore provided programming and vocals for UK metalcore band Bring Me the Horizon on their third studio album, There Is a Hell, Believe Me I've Seen It. There Is a Heaven, Let's Keep It a Secret. Later in the year, Sonny began a nationwide tour with Deadmau5 after being signed to mau5trap recordings and released his second EP, Scary Monsters and Nice Sprites. Moore kicked off the \"Project Blue Book Tour\" in 2011 with support from Porter Robinson, Tommy Lee and DJ Aero as well as appearances from Sofia Toufa for a new song titled \"Bring out the Devil.\" Skrillex unveiled several new songs on this tour including \"First Of The Year\" (formerly known as \"Equinox\"), \"Reptile\", and \"Cinema\" (remix of a Benny Benassi track). \"Reptile\" was featured in the TV commercial for Mortal Kombat 9, and \"First of the Year (Equinox)\" is featured on his follow up EP and remix companion to Scary Monsters and Nice Sprites, titled More Monsters and Sprites. In April 2011, Spin magazine premiered \"Get Up\", an exclusive new track from Korn that was produced by Skrillex. Korn made \"Get Up\" available for free download via their Facebook page. On April 15, 2011 KoRn joined Skrillex on stage for his set at Coachella 2011. On April 18, 2011, Sony Computer Entertainment (SCEA) development studio Naughty Dog released a trailer for the multiplayer component of their PlayStation 3 game Uncharted 3: Drake's Deception, featuring \"Kill EVERYBODY\" from Scary Monsters and Nice Sprites. In June 2011, \"More Monsters and Sprites\" was released on Beatport, an EP consisting of three original tracks, including \"First of the Year (Equinox)\" and two versions of his original track \"Ruffneck\". A leaked track entitled \"Ruffneck Bass\" had been leaked on the internet months prior which used the same sample as in the new \"Ruffneck\" tracks on the EP. Skrillex released a music video for \"Rock n' Roll (Will Take You to the Mountain)\" on his official YouTube page on June 20, 2011. \n\nOn August 17, 2011 Skrillex announced his label, OWSLA. \"The label's first releases will come from Bristol-based dubstep producer Koan Sound, electro-house newcomer Porter Robinson from North Carolina, singer/songwriter Alvin Risk, and San Francisco-based M Machine (formally Metropolis).\" Skrillex released a music video for \"First of the Year (Equinox)\" via Spin.com on August 19, 2011. In late August 2011 it was released that he would be appearing Knife Party's first release, collaborating on a Moombahton style track entitled \"Zoology\". A preview was released on YouTube. In late September 2011 he created the track \"Syndicate\" as promotion for the video game of the same name. Kaskade's 2011 album Fire & Ice features a collaboration between Kaskade and Skrillex entitled \"Lick It\". The video for Skrillex's song \"First of the Year (Equinox)\" appears on the first episode of the Beavis and Butt-head revival. On November 8, Skrillex stated that he intended to release an album entitled Voltage. Skrillex gave fans more info about Voltage in RockSound Magazine after a photoshoot for the cover and doing an extensive interview on his tour. For unknown reasons, however, the album was never released. On December 21, 2011, Skrillex unveiled the Bangarang EP for a Beatport release on December 23. On March 13, 2012, Beatport released OWSLA's second Free Treats sampler, Free Treats Vol. 2. The 19-track compilation features \"Ruffneck (FULL Flex) Munchi Anonymous Revolution Remix\", a remixed track by Skrillex. This new take on the track deviates from the original (released on the More Monsters and Sprites EP), with the remix being more characteristic of Electro House, though with a much slower tempo of 108 BPM, versus the original version's classic Dubstep tempo of 140 BPM, also straying from the typical Electro House tempo of 128 BPM. On August 12, 2012, his new side-project formed with Boys Noize called Dog Blood released an EP called Next Order/Middle Finger. \n\nInfluences:\nMoore has stated in an online interview that he has been a longtime fan of Warp, an electronic music label that has released recordings from artists such as Aphex Twin and Squarepusher. \n\nPersonal life:\nAs of February 2012, Skrillex has been dating fellow artist and singer, Ellie Goulding, who provided vocals for the Skrillex track, \"Summit\", featured on the EP, Bangarang.",

                                                    "text": "Sonny John Moore (born January 15, 1988), better known by his stage name Skrillex, is an American electronic music producer and singer-songwriter. Raised in Northeast Los Angeles and in Northern California, Moore joined the American post-hardcore band From First to Last as the lead singer in 2004, and recorded two studio albums with the band (Dear Diary, My Teen Angst Has a Body Count, 2004, and Heroine, 2006) before leaving to pursue a solo career in 2007. He began his first tour as a solo artist in late 2007. After recruiting a new band lineup, Moore joined the Alternative Press Tour to support bands such as All Time Low and The Rocket Summer, and appeared on the cover of Alternative Press' annual \"100 Bands You Need to Know\" issue. After releasing the Gypsyhook EP in 2009, Moore was scheduled to record his debut studio album, Bells, with producer Noah Shain. However, he ceased production of the album and began performing under the name Skrillex. After releasing the My Name is Skrillex EP for free download on his official MySpace page, he released the Scary Monsters and Nice Sprites EP in late-2010 and More Monsters and Sprites EP in mid-2011. Both have since become moderate commercial successes. On November 30, 2011, he was nominated for a total of five Grammy Awards at the 54th Grammy Awards, including Best New Artist and won three: \"Best Dance/Electronica Album,\" \"Best Dance Recording,\" and \"Best Remixed Recording, Non-Classical\". On December 5, 2011, the BBC announced that he had been nominated for their Sound of 2012 poll. On December 12, 2011, he was also named MTV's Electronic Dance Music Artist of the Year. \n\nBiography:\n\nBackground:\nMoore was born in the Highland Park neighborhood of Northeast Los Angeles, but moved to the Forest Hill neighborhood of San Francisco at the age of two, where he attended elementary school. At the ages of nine and ten, Moore attended a local boarding school located in the Mojave Desert LV, but eventually moved back to Northern California. By the age of twelve, his family moved him back to his birthplace of Northeast L.A., where he enrolled in a private academy school specializing in arts, and was then later home schooled at the age of fourteen due to bullying. In 2004, he learned he was adopted and dropped out of the program when he was sixteen years old. While a young teenager in Los Angeles, Moore would attend punk gigs in Mexican American neighborhoods in East and South Los Angeles, and later on electro club raves in the downtown's Silver Lake and Echo Park neighborhoods. \n\nFrom First to Last (2004-07):\nIn 2004, Moore contacted Matt Good of From First to Last about playing guitar for the band on their debut album. After flying out to Georgia, Moore was heard singing by three studio producers, Derrick Thomas, Eric Dale, and McHale Butler, and was then made lead singer, with Good playing guitar. In June 2004, Epitaph Records released the band's first full-length record with their new bandmate, Dear Diary, My Teen Angst Has a Body Count. After performing on several successful tours, two being the Vans Warped Tour and Dead by Dawn tour, they began recording their second album, Heroine with producer Ross Robinson. The album was released in March 2006 on Epitaph. With high record sales once again, the band found themselves part of many successful tours, until Moore started suffering vocal problems, causing the band to resign from several tours. After going through a successful vocal surgical procedure, Moore informed the band he would be permanently resigning to work on a solo career. FFTL's last show performed with Moore was in their hometown of Orlando at The House of Blues while touring with Atreyu. \n\nSolo career (2007-present):\n\nMoore announced he had left From First to Last to pursue a solo career. He then launched a Myspace page displaying three demos (\"Signal\", \"Equinox\", and \"Glow Worm\"). This led to Moore's first performance since his leaving From First to Last. On April 7, 2007, alongside harpist Carol Robbins, Moore played several original songs at a local art building. After months of releasing demos via Myspace, Moore played on the Team Sleep Tour with a full band. The tour also featured supporting acts Monster in the Machine and Strata. Moore made several demo CDs available on this tour, limited to about 30 per show. These CDs were tour exclusive, and were packaged in \"baby blue envelopes\", each with a unique drawing by Moore or bandmate. In February 2008, Alternative Press Magazine announced the second annual AP Tour, with All Time Low, The Rocket Summer, The Matches, and Forever the Sickest Kids, as well as Sonny Moore. The tour started in Houston, Texas on March 14 and went through North America, ending in Cleveland, Ohio on May 2, with the majority of the shows being sold out. All bands playing the tour would be featured on the cover of Alternative Press Magazine's annual 100 Bands You Need to Know special, and would be interviewed on the Alternative Press Podcast. During this tour Moore's line-up consisted of Sean Friday on drums, Christopher Null on guitar, and Aaron Rothe on keyboards. On April 7, 2009, he released Gypsyhook EP, a digital EP, which featured three songs and four remixes. Also included was a Japanese version of \"Mora\" entitled \"Êµ∑Ê∞¥\" (\"Kaisui\"). Physical copies of the EP were available at his shows. After going on tour with Innerpartysystem and Paper Route and opening for Chiodos on their European tour, Moore performed at Bamboozle on May 2. He performed on Bamboozle Left's Saints and Sinners stage on April 4. He toured with Hollywood Undead in April 2009 performing under the band name Sonny and the Blood Monkeys, with Chris Null (electric guitar), Sean Friday (drums, percussion & beats) and Aaron Rothe (keyboards, synthesizers, programming & turntables) Although no official statement has been given regarding the album, Moore has stated that Bells will no longer be released. \n\nProduction career:\n\nIn 2008, Moore began producing and performing under the alias Skrillex at clubs in the Los Angeles area. Previously, he had been known on the Internet as Twipz. On June 7, 2010, Moore released his official Skrillex debut EP, My Name is Skrillex as a free download. Moore provided programming and vocals for UK metalcore band Bring Me the Horizon on their third studio album, There Is a Hell, Believe Me I've Seen It. There Is a Heaven, Let's Keep It a Secret. Later in the year, Sonny began a nationwide tour with Deadmau5 after being signed to mau5trap recordings and released his second EP, Scary Monsters and Nice Sprites. Moore kicked off the \"Project Blue Book Tour\" in 2011 with support from Porter Robinson, Tommy Lee and DJ Aero as well as appearances from Sofia Toufa for a new song titled \"Bring out the Devil.\" Skrillex unveiled several new songs on this tour including \"First Of The Year\" (formerly known as \"Equinox\"), \"Reptile\", and \"Cinema\" (remix of a Benny Benassi track). \"Reptile\" was featured in the TV commercial for Mortal Kombat 9, and \"First of the Year (Equinox)\" is featured on his follow up EP and remix companion to Scary Monsters and Nice Sprites, titled More Monsters and Sprites. In April 2011, Spin magazine premiered \"Get Up\", an exclusive new track from Korn that was produced by Skrillex. Korn made \"Get Up\" available for free download via their Facebook page. On April 15, 2011 KoRn joined Skrillex on stage for his set at Coachella 2011. On April 18, 2011, Sony Computer Entertainment (SCEA) development studio Naughty Dog released a trailer for the multiplayer component of their PlayStation 3 game Uncharted 3: Drake's Deception, featuring \"Kill EVERYBODY\" from Scary Monsters and Nice Sprites. In June 2011, \"More Monsters and Sprites\" was released on Beatport, an EP consisting of three original tracks, including \"First of the Year (Equinox)\" and two versions of his original track \"Ruffneck\". A leaked track entitled \"Ruffneck Bass\" had been leaked on the internet months prior which used the same sample as in the new \"Ruffneck\" tracks on the EP. Skrillex released a music video for \"Rock n' Roll (Will Take You to the Mountain)\" on his official YouTube page on June 20, 2011. \n\nOn August 17, 2011 Skrillex announced his label, OWSLA. \"The label's first releases will come from Bristol-based dubstep producer Koan Sound, electro-house newcomer Porter Robinson from North Carolina, singer/songwriter Alvin Risk, and San Francisco-based M Machine (formally Metropolis).\" Skrillex released a music video for \"First of the Year (Equinox)\" via Spin.com on August 19, 2011. In late August 2011 it was released that he would be appearing Knife Party's first release, collaborating on a Moombahton style track entitled \"Zoology\". A preview was released on YouTube. In late September 2011 he created the track \"Syndicate\" as promotion for the video game of the same name. Kaskade's 2011 album Fire & Ice features a collaboration between Kaskade and Skrillex entitled \"Lick It\". The video for Skrillex's song \"First of the Year (Equinox)\" appears on the first episode of the Beavis and Butt-head revival. On November 8, Skrillex stated that he intended to release an album entitled Voltage. Skrillex gave fans more info about Voltage in RockSound Magazine after a photoshoot for the cover and doing an extensive interview on his tour. For unknown reasons, however, the album was never released. On December 21, 2011, Skrillex unveiled the Bangarang EP for a Beatport release on December 23. On March 13, 2012, Beatport released OWSLA's second Free Treats sampler, Free Treats Vol. 2. The 19-track compilation features \"Ruffneck (FULL Flex) Munchi Anonymous Revolution Remix\", a remixed track by Skrillex. This new take on the track deviates from the original (released on the More Monsters and Sprites EP), with the remix being more characteristic of Electro House, though with a much slower tempo of 108 BPM, versus the original version's classic Dubstep tempo of 140 BPM, also straying from the typical Electro House tempo of 128 BPM. On August 12, 2012, his new side-project formed with Boys Noize called Dog Blood released an EP called Next Order/Middle Finger. \n\nInfluences:\nMoore has stated in an online interview that he has been a longtime fan of Warp, an electronic music label that has released recordings from artists such as Aphex Twin and Squarepusher. \n\nPersonal life:\nAs of February 2012, Skrillex has been dating fellow artist and singer, Ellie Goulding, who provided vocals for the Skrillex track, \"Summit\", featured on the EP, Bangarang.",

                                "text": "For the American southern gospel singer, songwriter and guitarist see Jacky Jack White  Jack White (born John Anthony Gillis on July 9, 1975 in Detroit), American rock musician, producer, and actor. He is best known as the guitarist and lead vocalist of the rock duo The White Stripes (1997-2011) and more recently guitarist and vocalist of The Raconteurs, and drummer and vocalist for the band The Dead Weather.  Jack White first played as a professional musician in the early 1990s, as a drummer for the Detroit cowpunk band Goober & the Peas. White produced Loretta Lynn's Van Lear Rose in 2004, which won them a Grammy for best country album, and an additional Grammy for best country collaboration for the song Portland Oregon.    The Love Interruption Songfacts reports that his debut solo single, Love Interruption, was made available on January 30, 2012 at White's pay-to-join club Vault and at Jackwhiteiii.com. A week later, it was released on the singer's preferred format, vinyl. It was produced by the ex White Stripe and recorded at his own Third Man Studio in Nashville along with its exclusive non-LP B-side Machine Gun Silhouette. This was followed by his first solo album, Blunderbuss, later in 2012, and an accompanying tour. This is not said to indicate an end to either the Raconteurs or the Dead Weather.  His blaring guitar solos and ability to pull sound from the simplest of \"instruments\" are his greatest strengths along with his desire to partner with female vocalists.  He currently resides in Tennessee. He announced his divorce in 2011 from wife since 2005, fellow musician Karen Elson, and they have two children. Third Man Records (White's label) and Elson's clothing boutique are also located there.  Last.fm Group: http://www.last.fm/group/Blunderbuss",

                                "text": "Jack White (n√© Gillis), often credited as Jack White III, is an American musician, singer, songwriter, record producer, multi-instrumentalist and occasional actor. He was best known as the vocalist, guitarist and pianist of The White Stripes until they split in February 2011, as well as a vocalist and guitarist for The Raconteurs and the drummer of The Dead Weather. White released his debut solo album, Blunderbuss, on April 24, 2012. He is ranked No. 70 on Rolling Stone's list of \"The 100 Greatest Guitarists of All Time\". White's popular and critical success with The White Stripes enabled him to collaborate as a solo artist with other renowned musicians, such as Beck, The Rolling Stones, Jeff Beck,Alicia Keys, Bob Dylan, Electric Six, Insane Clown Posse, and Loretta Lynn, whose 2004 album Van Lear Rose he produced and performed on. In 2006, White became a founding member of the rock band The Raconteurs. In 2009, he became a founding member and drummer of his third commercially successful group, The Dead Weather. He was awarded the title of \"Nashville Music City Ambassador\" by the Nashville mayor Karl Dean in 2011. \n\nEarly life:\nOf Polish, Scottish, and Canadian descent, John Anthony Gillis, the son of Teresa and Gorman Gillis, was born the youngest of ten children (six brothers, three sisters) in a lower middle-class neighborhood in Detroit, Michigan. He grew up in a Catholic family. His father and mother worked for the Archdiocese of Detroit, as the Building Maintenance Superintendent and secretary in the Cardinal's office, respectively. White eventually became an altar boy, which landed him an uncredited role in the 1987 movie The Rosary Murders, filmed mainly at Holy Redeemer parish in southwest Detroit. As a child he was a fan of classical music. He attended Cass Technical High School in Detroit. He began playing an instrument, a drum, at the age of six. As a teenager, White was already listening to the blues and 1960s rock that would influence him in The White Stripes,Son House and Blind Willie McTell being among his favorite blues musicians. He and his childhood friend, Dominic Suchyta (NKA Dominic Davis), would listen to records in White's attic on weekends and began to record cover songs on an old four-track reel to reel tape machine. At the time White was described as \"a kid with short hair and braces\". He has said in many interviews that Son House's \"Grinnin' In Your Face\" is his favorite song of all time. In 2005 on 60 Minutes, White told Mike Wallace that his life could have turned out differently. \"I'd got accepted to a seminary in Wisconsin, and I was gonna become a priest, but at the last second I thought, 'I'll just go to public school. I had just gotten a new amplifier in my bedroom, and I didn't think I was allowed to take it with me.\" At 15, White began a three-year upholstery apprenticeship with a family friend, Brian Muldoon. White credits Muldoon with exposing him to punk music and pushing him to play music with Muldoon as a band: \"He played drums, well I guess I'll play guitar then.\" The two recorded an album, Makers of High Grade Suites, as The Upholsterers. White later started a one-man business of his own, Third Man Upholstery. The slogan of his business was \"Your Furniture's Not Dead\" and the color scheme was yellow and black--including a yellow van, a yellow-and-black uniform, and a yellow clipboard. Although Third Man Upholstery never lacked business, White claims that it was unprofitable, because of his complacency about money and his business practices that were perceived as unprofessional, including making bills out in crayon and writing poetry inside the furniture. Shortly thereafter, White landed his first professional gig, as the drummer for the Detroit band Goober & the Peas. He also played in other local bands and did solo shows. \n\nRecording career:\n\nThe White Stripes:\n\nWhite formed The White Stripes in 1997, along with Meg White, The band began its career as part of the Michigan garage rock underground music scene, playing with local bands such as Bantam Rooster, The Dirtbombs, The Paybacks, Rocket 455, and The Henchmen, among others. In 1998, The White Stripes were signed to Italy Records, a small and independent Detroit-based garage punk label, by Dave Buick. The band released its self-titled debut album in 1999, and a year later the album was followed up by the cult classicDe Stijl. The album eventually peaked at No. 38 in Billboard's Independent Albums chart when the band had established their popularity. While performing and in music videos, Jack and Meg are very recognisable visually, as they dress only in red, white, and black. In 2001 the band released White Blood Cells. The album's stripped-down garage rock sound drew critical acclaim in the UK and soon afterward in the US, making The White Stripes one of the more acclaimed bands of 2002. The album was followed up in 2003 by the commercially and critically successfulElephant. Allmusic wrote that the album \"sounds even more pissed-off, paranoid and stunning than its predecessor ... darker and more difficult than White Blood Cells. \" The album's first single, \"Seven Nation Army\", was the band's most successful. The band's fifth album, Get Behind Me Satan, was recorded in White's own home and marked a change in the band's musical direction, with piano-driven melodies and experimentation with marimba and a more rhythm-based guitar playing by White. The band's sixth album Icky Thump, released in 2007, entered the UK Albums Chart at number one and debuted at number two on the Billboard 200. The album's sound also included more punk, garage and blues influences than its predecessor. In late 2007, the band announced the cancellation of 18 tour dates due to Meg White's acute anxiety problems. White had revealed plans to release a seventh, as of yet untitled album in the summer of 2009. However, this has yet to happen. The band also made their first live appearance since Meg's anxiety problems in September 2007 on the final episode of Late Night with Conan O'Brien on February 20, 2009. A documentary, The White Stripes: Under Great White Northern Lights, about the band's 2007 tour, in which they played a gig in every Canadian province and territory, appeared in the 2009 Toronto International Film Festival. In July 2007, The White Stripes made history by playing the shortest concert ever only playing one note, in St John's, Newfoundland. They played a full show later that night at the Mile One Centre in downtown St. John's. On February 2, 2011, it was reported on the main page of whitestripes.com that the duo has decided to part ways. White stated that it was not due to health issues or artistic differences but there were a \"myriad of reasons\". \n\nThe Raconteurs:\nWhite formed The Raconteurs in 2005 along with Brendan Benson, Jack Lawrence and Patrick Keeler. The origin of the band was the song 'Steady, As She Goes' which White wrote along with Benson. This inspired them to create a full band with the addition of Lawrence and Keeler. The band came together in Detroit during 2005 and, for the remainder of the year, recorded when time allowed. The band's debut album Broken Boy Soldiers was recorded at Benson's home in Detroit. The band set out on tour to support the album, including eight dates as the opening act for Bob Dylan. The group's second album, Consolers of the Lonely, and its first single, \"Salute Your Solution\", simultaneously in 2008. The album received a Grammy nomination. \n\nThe Dead Weather:\n\nIn early 2009, Jack White formed a new group called The Dead Weather with The Kills frontwoman Alison Mosshart. White takes drum and vocal duties, while The Raconteurs bassist Jack Lawrence and Queens of the Stone Age keyboardist and guitarist Dean Fertita round the four piece out. The group debuted a handful of new tracks on March 11, 2009 in Nashville from their debut album Horehound, which came out July 13, 2009 in Europe and July 14, 2009 in North America, on White's Third Man Records label. On October 16, 2009, Mosshart confirmed that the second album was \"halfway done\". The first single \"Die by the Drop\" was released on March 30, 2010. The new album, Sea of Cowards was released on May 7 in Ireland, then on May 11, 2010, in the U.S. and May 10 in the United Kingdom, and again, on White's Third Man Records. \n\nSolo career:\nIt was rumored that in 2003 White collaborated on Electric Six's song \"Danger! High Voltage.\" Both he and the Electric Six denied this, and the vocal work was credited officially to John S O'Leary. However, a recent radio interview with Tim Shaw on Kerrang! 105.2 in the UK had Electric Six lead singer Dick Valentine talking openly about White singing on this song as well as speculating on the amount of money he was paid ($60,000). Also, a Q magazine article stated that Jack White did in fact work with Electric Six on the song \"Gay Bar\". In 2008, White collaborated with Alicia Keys on the song \"Another Way to Die\", the theme song for the James Bond film Quantum of Solace. He performed five songs for the Cold Mountain soundtrack; \"Sittin' on Top of the World\", \"Wayfaring Stranger\", \"Never Far Away\", \"Christmas Time Soon Will Be Over\" and \"Great High Mountain\". In 2009, Jack White was featured in It Might Get Loud, a film in which he, Jimmy Page, and The Edge come together to discuss the electric guitar and each artist's different playing methods. White's first solo single, \"Fly Farm Blues,\" was written and recorded in 10 minutes during the filming of the movie, in August 2009. The single went on sale as a 7-inch vinyl record from Third Man Records and as a digital single available through iTunes on August 11. In November 2010, producer Danger Mouse announced that White has been recruited for his collaboration with Daniele Luppi entitled Rome along with Norah Jones. White provided vocals to three songs on the album: \"The Rose with the Broken Neck,\" \"Two Against One\" and \"The World.\" The song \"You Know That I Know\", finished and performed by White, was featured on The Lost Notebooks of Hank Williams, released on October 4, 2011. On January 30, 2012 White released \"Love Interruption\" as the first single of his debut solo album, Blunderbuss, which was released on April 24, 2012. On March 3, 2012, he appeared on Saturday Night Live as the musical guest, with Lindsay Lohan hosting. He'll be playing selected dates in the summer, with festivals such as Radio 1's Hackney Weekend, Sasquatch! Music Festival, Fuji Rock Festival in Japan, one of the biggest festivals in the world, Rock Werchter in Belgium, and later in the year, he'll be headlining Austin City Limits Music Festival. For his solo shows, White tours with two bands. One, The Peacocks, is all-female, and the other, The Buzzards (sometimes called Los Buzzardos), is all-male. \n\nMusical equipment and sound:\nThe guitars White uses live are two 1965 JB Hutto Montgomery Airlines (one which he received from a fan), a three pickup Airline Town & Country (used on tour with the Raconteurs and in the \"Steady As She Goes\" music video), a Harmony Rocket, a 1970s-era Crestwood Astral II, 1950s-era Kay Hollowbody (given to him by his brother in return for a favor), a Gretsch White Penguin (as seen in the music video for Icky Thump), and a custom Gretsch Rancher Falcon acoustic guitar. When playing with the Raconteurs, White usually plays two custom Gretsch-styled copies of the Duo Jet double-cutaway guitar, which were made in collaboration with his Seattle luthier, Randy Parsons. His main guitar is dubbed the Triple Jet, which is made of copper and features a Gretsch logo from 1912. For their first tour, Jack also played Gretsch Anniversary Jr. with a Bigsby vibrato tailpiece and three Filtertron pickups. He also uses a Gretsch Rancher acoustic guitar and he now uses a custom Gretsch Anniversary Jr. with two cutaways, a built-in retractable microphone, and a theremin next to the Bigsby. Jack has dubbed this one the \"Triple Green Machine\". Also, he plays occasionally with his Gretsch Rancher, a Gibson J-160E. Also, he plays a Gretsch Duo Jet in Cadillac Green. Recently, he has featured his latest Gretsch, a custom white Billy Gibbons/Bo Diddley signature Gretsch Jupiter Thunderbird in the music video for \"Another Way to Die\", this guitar is also used on his concerts with The Dead Weather, but he also uses a black left-handed one since Sea of Cowards came out. He has also been known to play Fender Telecasters, featuring one in the music video for Loretta Lynn's \"Portland, Oregon\". Jack White has also played in live shows, mainly with The Dead Weather, a Daddy Mojo Stove Pipe Cigar Box Guitar. White uses numerous effects to create his live sound, most notably a DigiTech Whammy WH-4 to create the rapid modulations in pitch he uses in his solos. In concert with an MXR Micro Amp and custom Electro-Harmonix Big Muff Distortion/Sustainer, White can produce a very distinctive sound. In 2005, for the single \"Blue Orchid,\" White employed a new Electro-Harmonix creation, the Polyphonic Octave Generator (POG). Similar to (but more versatile than) the Whammy IV, the POG lets the user mix in several octave effects into one along with the dry signal. He also has three Z.Vex Tremolo Probes, that are hand painted black. All of the pedals that he uses live have been professionally painted red to match his red/black/white color scheme (with the exception of his Whammy and the other pedals that are already red). He plugs this setup into a 1970s Fender Twin Reverb and two 100-Watt Sears Silvertone 6x10 combo amplifiers. He also has a Sonic Machine Factory 15 Watt amp in red that can be seen in Under Great White Northern Lights. He uses this as a travel amp for secret or small shows, and also as the amp for his various keyboards when playing for a larger audience. With the Raconteurs, he has many more unusual pedals. And also, for the Raconteurs' 2008 tour, he had all of his pedals copper plated by Analog Man. White also produces a \"fake\" bass tone by playing the Kay Hollowbody and JB Hutto Montgomery Airline guitars through a Whammy IV set to one octave down for a very thick, low, rumbling sound, which he uses most notably on the songs \"Seven Nation Army\" and \"The Hardest Button to Button\" during live performances. On occasion, White also plays other instruments, such as a Black Gibson F-4 mandolin (\"Little Ghost\"), piano (on most tracks from Get Behind Me Satan, and various others), and an electric piano on such tracks as \"The Air Near My Fingers\" and \"I'm Finding it Harder to be a Gentleman\". White also plays percussion instruments such as the marimba (as on \"The Nurse\"), drums and tambourine. For the White Stripes' 2007 tour, he played a custom-finish Hammond A-100 organ with a Leslie 3300 speaker, which was subsequently loaned to Bob Dylan, and currently resides at Third Man Studios. On Broken Boy Soldiers, he is credited as playing the album's synths and organ; however, bandmate Brendan Benson also received credit for these instruments and it is unclear who played on which song. With the Dead Weather, Jack plays a custom Ludwig Classic Maple kit in Black Oyster Pearl. The sizes consist of the following: 16x26 kick, 5x16 snare (primary) 12x14 marching snare (secondary), 7x16 rack tom 14x16 floor tom, two 16x16 floor toms, Paiste 2002 24\"crash, 24\"ride and two 16\" crashes as hi-hats. For the 2009 Full Flash Blank tour, Jack used a drum head with the Three Brides of Dracula on the front, but in 2010, Jack employs a new drum head, upon the release of Sea of Cowards, which has an image of The Third Man himself: Harry Lime attempting to escape certain capture in the sewers of Vienna. During the American leg of the 2010 tour, Jack switched his drum head again featuring a picture of himself in the guise he wore on the cover of Sea of Cowards. This drum head is called Sam Kay by some fans, referring to the insert inside of the 12\" LP. In 2010, Jack White added an acoustic guitar to his collection named Veronica Lake. It is a custom white Gretsch Rancher with a gold double pickguard and a picture of Veronica Lake on the back. He is currently playing it with his band The Dead Weather. It is the newest addition to \"Jack's Girlfriends\" which already include Claudette Colbert that he plays In the Raconteurs, and Rita Hayworth that he plays in the White Stripes. According to Joe Chiccarelli, engineer for Icky Thump, White is not very technical when it comes to capturing his sound on record: \"Usually he wouldn't talk in terms of compression or EQ or any of those things, it was always about what can we do to give something more aggression or hit you in the face more. Jack's brilliance is his understanding of great emotional performances, and of what it takes to make something come alive through the speakers and have an impact.\" \n\nPersonal life:\n\nWhite gives few interviews and reveals few details of his private life. He states that he does not consider it relevant to his art, saying \"It's the same thing as asking Michelangelo, 'What kind of shoes do you wear?'...In the end, it doesn't really matter ... the only thing that's going to be left is our records and photos.\" A topic of intrigue has been the actual relationship between Jack and Meg White. In early interviews, the pair presented themselves as siblings, two of ten. The Flaming Lips touch on this in their song \"Thank You Jack White (for the Fiber-Optic Jesus That You Gave Me)\" released on their 2003 EP Fight Test. However, the Detroit Free Press produced copies of both a marriage license and divorce certificate, confirming Jack and Meg's history as a married couple. Neither addresses the truth officially and over time, they have become less verbal about the origins of their relationship. Jack White has said, though, that siblings are \"mated for life\", thus such relationships distract less from the music. Jack mentions them being brother and sister in the documentary Under Great White Northern Lights. In the early 1990s, Meg White worked as a bartender at Memphis Smoke, a bar in downtown Royal Oak (a Detroit suburb), where she first met Jack, then still known under his original surname 'Gillis'. They were married on September 21, 1996 and were divorced on March 24, 2000. Jack took her last name. White is often referred to as eccentric. For instance, he has an obsession with the number three. On November 7, 2005, it was widely reported that White had changed his name to \"Three Quid\" (quid is British slang for pound sterling). However, most reports indicated that this would only last until the end of the tour. On December 13, 2003, White was involved in an altercation with Jason Stollsteimer, lead singer of The Von Bondies, at the Magic Stick, a Detroit club. White was charged with misdemeanor aggravated assault. He pleaded guilty to the lesser charge of assault and battery, and was fined $750 (including court costs), and was sentenced to take anger management classes. In 2003, White made his acting debut in Mutant Swinger from Mars, and had a brief but highly publicized romantic relationship with actress Ren√©e Zellweger, whom he met during the filming of Cold Mountain. That summer, the couple were in a car accident in which White broke his left index finger and was forced to reschedule much of the summer tour. He posted the footage of his finger surgery on the web for fans. White and Zellweger's breakup became public in December 2004. White met British model Karen Elson (twin sister of Kate Elson) when she appeared in The White Stripes music video for \"Blue Orchid\". The video's director, Floria Sigismondi, noted \"you sensed an energy between them\". They married on June 1, 2005 in Manaus, Brazil. The wedding took place in a canoe on the Amazon River and was officiated by a shaman. A Roman Catholic priest later convalidated their marriage. Manager Ian Montone was the best man and Meg White was the maid of honor. Official wedding announcements stated that \"it was the first marriage\" for both. On May 2, 2006, the couple had a daughter, Scarlett Teresa White. Their second child, Henry Lee White, was born on August 7, 2007. The White family resides in Brentwood, Tennessee, a suburb south of Nashville, where Elson managed a vintage clothing store called Venus & Mars. The couple announced their divorce in June 2011, throwing a divorce party to celebrate their sixth anniversary and the \"making and breaking of the sacred union of marriage,\" according to the invitation sent to guests. In a press statement, the couple vowed to remain \"dear and trusted friends and co-parents.\" It is rumored that Karen Elson is \"Mildred\" of the Third Man Records produced album, \"Mildred and The Mice\". In 2006, it was revealed in the Sunday Times Rich List that White and his British wife Elson had a joint fortune of at least ¬£20 million (US$37 million). This ranked them at seventh place in the list of entertainers under age 30 who were born or live in the United Kingdom, ahead of the likes of Orlando Bloom and Kate Winslet. \n\nTV appearances:\nOn January 9, 2012, Jack White appeared on American Pickers.

He is best known as the guitarist and lead vocalist of the rock duo The White Stripes (1997-2011) and more recently guitarist and vocalist of The Raconteurs, and drummer and vocalist for the band The Dead Weather.  Jack White first played as a professional musician in the early 1990s, as a drummer for the Detroit cowpunk band Goober & the Peas. White produced Loretta Lynn's Van Lear Rose in 2004, which won them a Grammy for best country album, and an additional Grammy for best country collaboration for the song Portland Oregon.    The Love Interruption Songfacts reports that his debut solo single, Love Interruption, was made available on January 30, 2012 at White's pay-to-join club Vault and at Jackwhiteiii.com. A week later, it was released on the singer's preferred format, vinyl. It was produced by the ex White Stripe and recorded at his own Third Man Studio in Nashville along with its exclusive non-LP B-side Machine Gun Silhouette. This was followed by his first solo album, Blunderbuss, later in 2012, and an accompanying tour. This is not said to indicate an end to either the Raconteurs or the Dead Weather.  His blaring guitar solos and ability to pull sound from the simplest of \"instruments\" are his greatest strengths along with his desire to partner with female vocalists.  He currently resides in Tennessee. He announced his divorce in 2011 from wife since 2005, fellow musician Karen Elson, and they have two children. Third Man Records (White's label) and Elson's clothing boutique are also located there.  Last.fm Group: http://www.last.fm/group/Blunderbuss",

                                "text": "Jack White (n√© Gillis), often credited as Jack White III, is an American musician, singer, songwriter, record producer, multi-instrumentalist and occasional actor. He was best known as the vocalist, guitarist and pianist of The White Stripes until they split in February 2011, as well as a vocalist and guitarist for The Raconteurs and the drummer of The Dead Weather. White released his debut solo album, Blunderbuss, on April 24, 2012. He is ranked No. 70 on Rolling Stone's list of \"The 100 Greatest Guitarists of All Time\". White's popular and critical success with The White Stripes enabled him to collaborate as a solo artist with other renowned musicians, such as Beck, The Rolling Stones, Jeff Beck,Alicia Keys, Bob Dylan, Electric Six, Insane Clown Posse, and Loretta Lynn, whose 2004 album Van Lear Rose he produced and performed on. In 2006, White became a founding member of the rock band The Raconteurs. In 2009, he became a founding member and drummer of his third commercially successful group, The Dead Weather. He was awarded the title of \"Nashville Music City Ambassador\" by the Nashville mayor Karl Dean in 2011. \n\nEarly life:\nOf Polish, Scottish, and Canadian descent, John Anthony Gillis, the son of Teresa and Gorman Gillis, was born the youngest of ten children (six brothers, three sisters) in a lower middle-class neighborhood in Detroit, Michigan. He grew up in a Catholic family. His father and mother worked for the Archdiocese of Detroit, as the Building Maintenance Superintendent and secretary in the Cardinal's office, respectively. White eventually became an altar boy, which landed him an uncredited role in the 1987 movie The Rosary Murders, filmed mainly at Holy Redeemer parish in southwest Detroit. As a child he was a fan of classical music. He attended Cass Technical High School in Detroit. He began playing an instrument, a drum, at the age of six. As a teenager, White was already listening to the blues and 1960s rock that would influence him in The White Stripes,Son House and Blind Willie McTell being among his favorite blues musicians. He and his childhood friend, Dominic Suchyta (NKA Dominic Davis), would listen to records in White's attic on weekends and began to record cover songs on an old four-track reel to reel tape machine. At the time White was described as \"a kid with short hair and braces\". He has said in many interviews that Son House's \"Grinnin' In Your Face\" is his favorite song of all time. In 2005 on 60 Minutes, White told Mike Wallace that his life could have turned out differently. \"I'd got accepted to a seminary in Wisconsin, and I was gonna become a priest, but at the last second I thought, 'I'll just go to public school. I had just gotten a new amplifier in my bedroom, and I didn't think I was allowed to take it with me.\" At 15, White began a three-year upholstery apprenticeship with a family friend, Brian Muldoon. White credits Muldoon with exposing him to punk music and pushing him to play music with Muldoon as a band: \"He played drums, well I guess I'll play guitar then.\" The two recorded an album, Makers of High Grade Suites, as The Upholsterers. White later started a one-man business of his own, Third Man Upholstery. The slogan of his business was \"Your Furniture's Not Dead\" and the color scheme was yellow and black--including a yellow van, a yellow-and-black uniform, and a yellow clipboard. Although Third Man Upholstery never lacked business, White claims that it was unprofitable, because of his complacency about money and his business practices that were perceived as unprofessional, including making bills out in crayon and writing poetry inside the furniture. Shortly thereafter, White landed his first professional gig, as the drummer for the Detroit band Goober & the Peas. He also played in other local bands and did solo shows. \n\nRecording career:\n\nThe White Stripes:\n\nWhite formed The White Stripes in 1997, along with Meg White, The band began its career as part of the Michigan garage rock underground music scene, playing with local bands such as Bantam Rooster, The Dirtbombs, The Paybacks, Rocket 455, and The Henchmen, among others. In 1998, The White Stripes were signed to Italy Records, a small and independent Detroit-based garage punk label, by Dave Buick. The band released its self-titled debut album in 1999, and a year later the album was followed up by the cult classicDe Stijl. The album eventually peaked at No. 38 in Billboard's Independent Albums chart when the band had established their popularity. While performing and in music videos, Jack and Meg are very recognisable visually, as they dress only in red, white, and black. In 2001 the band released White Blood Cells. The album's stripped-down garage rock sound drew critical acclaim in the UK and soon afterward in the US, making The White Stripes one of the more acclaimed bands of 2002. The album was followed up in 2003 by the commercially and critically successfulElephant. Allmusic wrote that the album \"sounds even more pissed-off, paranoid and stunning than its predecessor ... darker and more difficult than White Blood Cells. \" The album's first single, \"Seven Nation Army\", was the band's most successful. The band's fifth album, Get Behind Me Satan, was recorded in White's own home and marked a change in the band's musical direction, with piano-driven melodies and experimentation with marimba and a more rhythm-based guitar playing by White. The band's sixth album Icky Thump, released in 2007, entered the UK Albums Chart at number one and debuted at number two on the Billboard 200. The album's sound also included more punk, garage and blues influences than its predecessor. In late 2007, the band announced the cancellation of 18 tour dates due to Meg White's acute anxiety problems. White had revealed plans to release a seventh, as of yet untitled album in the summer of 2009. However, this has yet to happen. The band also made their first live appearance since Meg's anxiety problems in September 2007 on the final episode of Late Night with Conan O'Brien on February 20, 2009. A documentary, The White Stripes: Under Great White Northern Lights, about the band's 2007 tour, in which they played a gig in every Canadian province and territory, appeared in the 2009 Toronto International Film Festival. In July 2007, The White Stripes made history by playing the shortest concert ever only playing one note, in St John's, Newfoundland. They played a full show later that night at the Mile One Centre in downtown St. John's. On February 2, 2011, it was reported on the main page of whitestripes.com that the duo has decided to part ways. White stated that it was not due to health issues or artistic differences but there were a \"myriad of reasons\". \n\nThe Raconteurs:\nWhite formed The Raconteurs in 2005 along with Brendan Benson, Jack Lawrence and Patrick Keeler. The origin of the band was the song 'Steady, As She Goes' which White wrote along with Benson. This inspired them to create a full band with the addition of Lawrence and Keeler. The band came together in Detroit during 2005 and, for the remainder of the year, recorded when time allowed. The band's debut album Broken Boy Soldiers was recorded at Benson's home in Detroit. The band set out on tour to support the album, including eight dates as the opening act for Bob Dylan. The group's second album, Consolers of the Lonely, and its first single, \"Salute Your Solution\", simultaneously in 2008. The album received a Grammy nomination. \n\nThe Dead Weather:\n\nIn early 2009, Jack White formed a new group called The Dead Weather with The Kills frontwoman Alison Mosshart. White takes drum and vocal duties, while The Raconteurs bassist Jack Lawrence and Queens of the Stone Age keyboardist and guitarist Dean Fertita round the four piece out. The group debuted a handful of new tracks on March 11, 2009 in Nashville from their debut album Horehound, which came out July 13, 2009 in Europe and July 14, 2009 in North America, on White's Third Man Records label. On October 16, 2009, Mosshart confirmed that the second album was \"halfway done\". The first single \"Die by the Drop\" was released on March 30, 2010. The new album, Sea of Cowards was released on May 7 in Ireland, then on May 11, 2010, in the U.S. and May 10 in the United Kingdom, and again, on White's Third Man Records. \n\nSolo career:\nIt was rumored that in 2003 White collaborated on Electric Six's song \"Danger! High Voltage.\" Both he and the Electric Six denied this, and the vocal work was credited officially to John S O'Leary. However, a recent radio interview with Tim Shaw on Kerrang! 105.2 in the UK had Electric Six lead singer Dick Valentine talking openly about White singing on this song as well as speculating on the amount of money he was paid ($60,000). Also, a Q magazine article stated that Jack White did in fact work with Electric Six on the song \"Gay Bar\". In 2008, White collaborated with Alicia Keys on the song \"Another Way to Die\", the theme song for the James Bond film Quantum of Solace. He performed five songs for the Cold Mountain soundtrack; \"Sittin' on Top of the World\", \"Wayfaring Stranger\", \"Never Far Away\", \"Christmas Time Soon Will Be Over\" and \"Great High Mountain\". In 2009, Jack White was featured in It Might Get Loud, a film in which he, Jimmy Page, and The Edge come together to discuss the electric guitar and each artist's different playing methods. White's first solo single, \"Fly Farm Blues,\" was written and recorded in 10 minutes during the filming of the movie, in August 2009. The single went on sale as a 7-inch vinyl record from Third Man Records and as a digital single available through iTunes on August 11. In November 2010, producer Danger Mouse announced that White has been recruited for his collaboration with Daniele Luppi entitled Rome along with Norah Jones. White provided vocals to three songs on the album: \"The Rose with the Broken Neck,\" \"Two Against One\" and \"The World.\" The song \"You Know That I Know\", finished and performed by White, was featured on The Lost Notebooks of Hank Williams, released on October 4, 2011. On January 30, 2012 White released \"Love Interruption\" as the first single of his debut solo album, Blunderbuss, which was released on April 24, 2012. On March 3, 2012, he appeared on Saturday Night Live as the musical guest, with Lindsay Lohan hosting. He'll be playing selected dates in the summer, with festivals such as Radio 1's Hackney Weekend, Sasquatch! Music Festival, Fuji Rock Festival in Japan, one of the biggest festivals in the world, Rock Werchter in Belgium, and later in the year, he'll be headlining Austin City Limits Music Festival. For his solo shows, White tours with two bands. One, The Peacocks, is all-female, and the other, The Buzzards (sometimes called Los Buzzardos), is all-male. \n\nMusical equipment and sound:\nThe guitars White uses live are two 1965 JB Hutto Montgomery Airlines (one which he received from a fan), a three pickup Airline Town & Country (used on tour with the Raconteurs and in the \"Steady As She Goes\" music video), a Harmony Rocket, a 1970s-era Crestwood Astral II, 1950s-era Kay Hollowbody (given to him by his brother in return for a favor), a Gretsch White Penguin (as seen in the music video for Icky Thump), and a custom Gretsch Rancher Falcon acoustic guitar. When playing with the Raconteurs, White usually plays two custom Gretsch-styled copies of the Duo Jet double-cutaway guitar, which were made in collaboration with his Seattle luthier, Randy Parsons. His main guitar is dubbed the Triple Jet, which is made of copper and features a Gretsch logo from 1912. For their first tour, Jack also played Gretsch Anniversary Jr. with a Bigsby vibrato tailpiece and three Filtertron pickups. He also uses a Gretsch Rancher acoustic guitar and he now uses a custom Gretsch Anniversary Jr. with two cutaways, a built-in retractable microphone, and a theremin next to the Bigsby. Jack has dubbed this one the \"Triple Green Machine\". Also, he plays occasionally with his Gretsch Rancher, a Gibson J-160E. Also, he plays a Gretsch Duo Jet in Cadillac Green. Recently, he has featured his latest Gretsch, a custom white Billy Gibbons/Bo Diddley signature Gretsch Jupiter Thunderbird in the music video for \"Another Way to Die\", this guitar is also used on his concerts with The Dead Weather, but he also uses a black left-handed one since Sea of Cowards came out. He has also been known to play Fender Telecasters, featuring one in the music video for Loretta Lynn's \"Portland, Oregon\". Jack White has also played in live shows, mainly with The Dead Weather, a Daddy Mojo Stove Pipe Cigar Box Guitar. White uses numerous effects to create his live sound, most notably a DigiTech Whammy WH-4 to create the rapid modulations in pitch he uses in his solos. In concert with an MXR Micro Amp and custom Electro-Harmonix Big Muff Distortion/Sustainer, White can produce a very distinctive sound. In 2005, for the single \"Blue Orchid,\" White employed a new Electro-Harmonix creation, the Polyphonic Octave Generator (POG). Similar to (but more versatile than) the Whammy IV, the POG lets the user mix in several octave effects into one along with the dry signal. He also has three Z.Vex Tremolo Probes, that are hand painted black. All of the pedals that he uses live have been professionally painted red to match his red/black/white color scheme (with the exception of his Whammy and the other pedals that are already red). He plugs this setup into a 1970s Fender Twin Reverb and two 100-Watt Sears Silvertone 6x10 combo amplifiers. He also has a Sonic Machine Factory 15 Watt amp in red that can be seen in Under Great White Northern Lights. He uses this as a travel amp for secret or small shows, and also as the amp for his various keyboards when playing for a larger audience. With the Raconteurs, he has many more unusual pedals. And also, for the Raconteurs' 2008 tour, he had all of his pedals copper plated by Analog Man. White also produces a \"fake\" bass tone by playing the Kay Hollowbody and JB Hutto Montgomery Airline guitars through a Whammy IV set to one octave down for a very thick, low, rumbling sound, which he uses most notably on the songs \"Seven Nation Army\" and \"The Hardest Button to Button\" during live performances. On occasion, White also plays other instruments, such as a Black Gibson F-4 mandolin (\"Little Ghost\"), piano (on most tracks from Get Behind Me Satan, and various others), and an electric piano on such tracks as \"The Air Near My Fingers\" and \"I'm Finding it Harder to be a Gentleman\". White also plays percussion instruments such as the marimba (as on \"The Nurse\"), drums and tambourine. For the White Stripes' 2007 tour, he played a custom-finish Hammond A-100 organ with a Leslie 3300 speaker, which was subsequently loaned to Bob Dylan, and currently resides at Third Man Studios. On Broken Boy Soldiers, he is credited as playing the album's synths and organ; however, bandmate Brendan Benson also received credit for these instruments and it is unclear who played on which song. With the Dead Weather, Jack plays a custom Ludwig Classic Maple kit in Black Oyster Pearl. The sizes consist of the following: 16x26 kick, 5x16 snare (primary) 12x14 marching snare (secondary), 7x16 rack tom 14x16 floor tom, two 16x16 floor toms, Paiste 2002 24\"crash, 24\"ride and two 16\" crashes as hi-hats. For the 2009 Full Flash Blank tour, Jack used a drum head with the Three Brides of Dracula on the front, but in 2010, Jack employs a new drum head, upon the release of Sea of Cowards, which has an image of The Third Man himself: Harry Lime attempting to escape certain capture in the sewers of Vienna. During the American leg of the 2010 tour, Jack switched his drum head again featuring a picture of himself in the guise he wore on the cover of Sea of Cowards. This drum head is called Sam Kay by some fans, referring to the insert inside of the 12\" LP. In 2010, Jack White added an acoustic guitar to his collection named Veronica Lake. It is a custom white Gretsch Rancher with a gold double pickguard and a picture of Veronica Lake on the back. He is currently playing it with his band The Dead Weather. It is the newest addition to \"Jack's Girlfriends\" which already include Claudette Colbert that he plays In the Raconteurs, and Rita Hayworth that he plays in the White Stripes. According to Joe Chiccarelli, engineer for Icky Thump, White is not very technical when it comes to capturing his sound on record: \"Usually he wouldn't talk in terms of compression or EQ or any of those things, it was always about what can we do to give something more aggression or hit you in the face more. Jack's brilliance is his understanding of great emotional performances, and of what it takes to make something come alive through the speakers and have an impact.\" \n\nPersonal life:\n\nWhite gives few interviews and reveals few details of his private life. He states that he does not consider it relevant to his art, saying \"It's the same thing as asking Michelangelo, 'What kind of shoes do you wear?'...In the end, it doesn't really matter ... the only thing that's going to be left is our records and photos.\" A topic of intrigue has been the actual relationship between Jack and Meg White. In early interviews, the pair presented themselves as siblings, two of ten. The Flaming Lips touch on this in their song \"Thank You Jack White (for the Fiber-Optic Jesus That You Gave Me)\" released on their 2003 EP Fight Test. However, the Detroit Free Press produced copies of both a marriage license and divorce certificate, confirming Jack and Meg's history as a married couple. Neither addresses the truth officially and over time, they have become less verbal about the origins of their relationship. Jack White has said, though, that siblings are \"mated for life\", thus such relationships distract less from the music. Jack mentions them being brother and sister in the documentary Under Great White Northern Lights. In the early 1990s, Meg White worked as a bartender at Memphis Smoke, a bar in downtown Royal Oak (a Detroit suburb), where she first met Jack, then still known under his original surname 'Gillis'. They were married on September 21, 1996 and were divorced on March 24, 2000. Jack took her last name. White is often referred to as eccentric. For instance, he has an obsession with the number three. On November 7, 2005, it was widely reported that White had changed his name to \"Three Quid\" (quid is British slang for pound sterling). However, most reports indicated that this would only last until the end of the tour. On December 13, 2003, White was involved in an altercation with Jason Stollsteimer, lead singer of The Von Bondies, at the Magic Stick, a Detroit club. White was charged with misdemeanor aggravated assault. He pleaded guilty to the lesser charge of assault and battery, and was fined $750 (including court costs), and was sentenced to take anger management classes. In 2003, White made his acting debut in Mutant Swinger from Mars, and had a brief but highly publicized romantic relationship with actress Ren√©e Zellweger, whom he met during the filming of Cold Mountain. That summer, the couple were in a car accident in which White broke his left index finger and was forced to reschedule much of the summer tour. He posted the footage of his finger surgery on the web for fans. White and Zellweger's breakup became public in December 2004. White met British model Karen Elson (twin sister of Kate Elson) when she appeared in The White Stripes music video for \"Blue Orchid\". The video's director, Floria Sigismondi, noted \"you sensed an energy between them\". They married on June 1, 2005 in Manaus, Brazil. The wedding took place in a canoe on the Amazon River and was officiated by a shaman. A Roman Catholic priest later convalidated their marriage. Manager Ian Montone was the best man and Meg White was the maid of honor. Official wedding announcements stated that \"it was the first marriage\" for both. On May 2, 2006, the couple had a daughter, Scarlett Teresa White. Their second child, Henry Lee White, was born on August 7, 2007. The White family resides in Brentwood, Tennessee, a suburb south of Nashville, where Elson managed a vintage clothing store called Venus & Mars. The couple announced their divorce in June 2011, throwing a divorce party to celebrate their sixth anniversary and the \"making and breaking of the sacred union of marriage,\" according to the invitation sent to guests. In a press statement, the couple vowed to remain \"dear and trusted friends and co-parents.\" It is rumored that Karen Elson is \"Mildred\" of the Third Man Records produced album, \"Mildred and The Mice\". In 2006, it was revealed in the Sunday Times Rich List that White and his British wife Elson had a joint fortune of at least ¬£20 million (US$37 million). This ranked them at seventh place in the list of entertainers under age 30 who were born or live in the United Kingdom, ahead of the likes of Orlando Bloom and Kate Winslet. \n\nTV appearances:\nOn January 9, 2012, Jack White appeared on American Pickers. In the episode Jack trades his photo booth, first Jukebox, and US$6,000 for a taxidermy elephant head. Jack White appeared as a guest of The Colbert Report in three consecutive episodes in 2011 (June 21-23), and again on April 26, 2012.",

                                "text": "Sonny John Moore (born January 15, 1988), better known by his stage name Skrillex, is an American electronic music producer and singer-songwriter. Raised in Northeast Los Angeles and in Northern California, Moore joined the American post-hardcore band From First to Last as the lead singer in 2004, and recorded two studio albums with the band (Dear Diary, My Teen Angst Has a Body Count, 2004, and Heroine, 2006) before leaving to pursue a solo career in 2007. He began his first tour as a solo artist in late 2007. After recruiting a new band lineup, Moore joined the Alternative Press Tour to support bands such as All Time Low and The Rocket Summer, and appeared on the cover of Alternative Press' annual \"100 Bands You Need to Know\" issue. After releasing the Gypsyhook EP in 2009, Moore was scheduled to record his debut studio album, Bells, with producer Noah Shain. However, he ceased production of the album and began performing under the name Skrillex. After releasing the My Name is Skrillex EP for free download on his official MySpace page, he released the Scary Monsters and Nice Sprites EP in late-2010 and More Monsters and Sprites EP in mid-2011. Both have since become moderate commercial successes. On November 30, 2011, he was nominated for a total of five Grammy Awards at the 54th Grammy Awards, including Best New Artist and won three: \"Best Dance/Electronica Album,\" \"Best Dance Recording,\" and \"Best Remixed Recording, Non-Classical\". On December 5, 2011, the BBC announced that he had been nominated for their Sound of 2012 poll. On December 12, 2011, he was also named MTV's Electronic Dance Music Artist of the Year. \n\nBiography:\n\nBackground:\nMoore was born in the Highland Park neighborhood of Northeast Los Angeles, but moved to the Forest Hill neighborhood of San Francisco at the age of two, where he attended elementary school. At the ages of nine and ten, Moore attended a local boarding school located in the Mojave Desert LV, but eventually moved back to Northern California. By the age of twelve, his family moved him back to his birthplace of Northeast L.A., where he enrolled in a private academy school specializing in arts, and was then later home schooled at the age of fourteen due to bullying. In 2004, he learned he was adopted and dropped out of the program when he was sixteen years old. While a young teenager in Los Angeles, Moore would attend punk gigs in Mexican American neighborhoods in East and South Los Angeles, and later on electro club raves in the downtown's Silver Lake and Echo Park neighborhoods. \n\nFrom First to Last (2004-07):\nIn 2004, Moore contacted Matt Good of From First to Last about playing guitar for the band on their debut album. After flying out to Georgia, Moore was heard singing by three studio producers, Derrick Thomas, Eric Dale, and McHale Butler, and was then made lead singer, with Good playing guitar. In June 2004, Epitaph Records released the band's first full-length record with their new bandmate, Dear Diary, My Teen Angst Has a Body Count. After performing on several successful tours, two being the Vans Warped Tour and Dead by Dawn tour, they began recording their second album, Heroine with producer Ross Robinson. The album was released in March 2006 on Epitaph. With high record sales once again, the band found themselves part of many successful tours, until Moore started suffering vocal problems, causing the band to resign from several tours. After going through a successful vocal surgical procedure, Moore informed the band he would be permanently resigning to work on a solo career. FFTL's last show performed with Moore was in their hometown of Orlando at The House of Blues while touring with Atreyu. \n\nSolo career (2007-present):\n\nMoore announced he had left From First to Last to pursue a solo career. He then launched a Myspace page displaying three demos (\"Signal\", \"Equinox\", and \"Glow Worm\"). This led to Moore's first performance since his leaving From First to Last. On April 7, 2007, alongside harpist Carol Robbins, Moore played several original songs at a local art building. After months of releasing demos via Myspace, Moore played on the Team Sleep Tour with a full band. The tour also featured supporting acts Monster in the Machine and Strata. Moore made several demo CDs available on this tour, limited to about 30 per show. These CDs were tour exclusive, and were packaged in \"baby blue envelopes\", each with a unique drawing by Moore or bandmate. In February 2008, Alternative Press Magazine announced the second annual AP Tour, with All Time Low, The Rocket Summer, The Matches, and Forever the Sickest Kids, as well as Sonny Moore. The tour started in Houston, Texas on March 14 and went through North America, ending in Cleveland, Ohio on May 2, with the majority of the shows being sold out. All bands playing the tour would be featured on the cover of Alternative Press Magazine's annual 100 Bands You Need to Know special, and would be interviewed on the Alternative Press Podcast. During this tour Moore's line-up consisted of Sean Friday on drums, Christopher Null on guitar, and Aaron Rothe on keyboards. On April 7, 2009, he released Gypsyhook EP, a digital EP, which featured three songs and four remixes. Also included was a Japanese version of \"Mora\" entitled \"Êµ∑Ê∞¥\" (\"Kaisui\"). Physical copies of the EP were available at his shows. After going on tour with Innerpartysystem and Paper Route and opening for Chiodos on their European tour, Moore performed at Bamboozle on May 2. He performed on Bamboozle Left's Saints and Sinners stage on April 4. He toured with Hollywood Undead in April 2009 performing under the band name Sonny and the Blood Monkeys, with Chris Null (electric guitar), Sean Friday (drums, percussion & beats) and Aaron Rothe (keyboards, synthesizers, programming & turntables) Although no official statement has been given regarding the album, Moore has stated that Bells will no longer be released. \n\nProduction career:\n\nIn 2008, Moore began producing and performing under the alias Skrillex at clubs in the Los Angeles area. Previously, he had been known on the Internet as Twipz. On June 7, 2010, Moore released his official Skrillex debut EP, My Name is Skrillex as a free download. Moore provided programming and vocals for UK metalcore band Bring Me the Horizon on their third studio album, There Is a Hell, Believe Me I've Seen It. There Is a Heaven, Let's Keep It a Secret. Later in the year, Sonny began a nationwide tour with Deadmau5 after being signed to mau5trap recordings and released his second EP, Scary Monsters and Nice Sprites. Moore kicked off the \"Project Blue Book Tour\" in 2011 with support from Porter Robinson, Tommy Lee and DJ Aero as well as appearances from Sofia Toufa for a new song titled \"Bring out the Devil.\" Skrillex unveiled several new songs on this tour including \"First Of The Year\" (formerly known as \"Equinox\"), \"Reptile\", and \"Cinema\" (remix of a Benny Benassi track). \"Reptile\" was featured in the TV commercial for Mortal Kombat 9, and \"First of the Year (Equinox)\" is featured on his follow up EP and remix companion to Scary Monsters and Nice Sprites, titled More Monsters and Sprites. In April 2011, Spin magazine premiered \"Get Up\", an exclusive new track from Korn that was produced by Skrillex. Korn made \"Get Up\" available for free download via their Facebook page. On April 15, 2011 KoRn joined Skrillex on stage for his set at Coachella 2011. On April 18, 2011, Sony Computer Entertainment (SCEA) development studio Naughty Dog released a trailer for the multiplayer component of their PlayStation 3 game Uncharted 3: Drake's Deception, featuring \"Kill EVERYBODY\" from Scary Monsters and Nice Sprites. In June 2011, \"More Monsters and Sprites\" was released on Beatport, an EP consisting of three original tracks, including \"First of the Year (Equinox)\" and two versions of his original track \"Ruffneck\". A leaked track entitled \"Ruffneck Bass\" had been leaked on the internet months prior which used the same sample as in the new \"Ruffneck\" tracks on the EP. Skrillex released a music video for \"Rock n' Roll (Will Take You to the Mountain)\" on his official YouTube page on June 20, 2011. \n\nOn August 17, 2011 Skrillex announced his label, OWSLA. \"The label's first releases will come from Bristol-based dubstep producer Koan Sound, electro-house newcomer Porter Robinson from North Carolina, singer/songwriter Alvin Risk, and San Francisco-based M Machine (formally Metropolis).\" Skrillex released a music video for \"First of the Year (Equinox)\" via Spin.com on August 19, 2011. In late August 2011 it was released that he would be appearing Knife Party's first release, collaborating on a Moombahton style track entitled \"Zoology\". A preview was released on YouTube. In late September 2011 he created the track \"Syndicate\" as promotion for the video game of the same name. Kaskade's 2011 album Fire & Ice features a collaboration between Kaskade and Skrillex entitled \"Lick It\". The video for Skrillex's song \"First of the Year (Equinox)\" appears on the first episode of the Beavis and Butt-head revival. On November 8, Skrillex stated that he intended to release an album entitled Voltage. Skrillex gave fans more info about Voltage in RockSound Magazine after a photoshoot for the cover and doing an extensive interview on his tour. For unknown reasons, however, the album was never released. On December 21, 2011, Skrillex unveiled the Bangarang EP for a Beatport release on December 23. On March 13, 2012, Beatport released OWSLA's second Free Treats sampler, Free Treats Vol. 2. The 19-track compilation features \"Ruffneck (FULL Flex) Munchi Anonymous Revolution Remix\", a remixed track by Skrillex. This new take on the track deviates from the original (released on the More Monsters and Sprites EP), with the remix being more characteristic of Electro House, though with a much slower tempo of 108 BPM, versus the original version's classic Dubstep tempo of 140 BPM, also straying from the typical Electro House tempo of 128 BPM. On August 12, 2012, his new side-project formed with Boys Noize called Dog Blood released an EP called Next Order/Middle Finger. \n\nInfluences:\nMoore has stated in an online interview that he has been a longtime fan of Warp, an electronic music label that has released recordings from artists such as Aphex Twin and Squarepusher. \n\nPersonal life:\nAs of February 2012, Skrillex has been dating fellow artist and singer, Ellie Goulding, who provided vocals for the Skrillex track, \"Summit\", featured on the EP, Bangarang.",

                                "text": "Sonny John Moore (born January 15, 1988), better known by his stage name Skrillex, is an American electronic music producer and singer-songwriter. Raised in Northeast Los Angeles and in Northern California, Moore joined the American post-hardcore band From First to Last as the lead singer in 2004, and recorded two studio albums with the band (Dear Diary, My Teen Angst Has a Body Count, 2004, and Heroine, 2006) before leaving to pursue a solo career in 2007. He began his first tour as a solo artist in late 2007. After recruiting a new band lineup, Moore joined the Alternative Press Tour to support bands such as All Time Low and The Rocket Summer, and appeared on the cover of Alternative Press' annual \"100 Bands You Need to Know\" issue. After releasing the Gypsyhook EP in 2009, Moore was scheduled to record his debut studio album, Bells, with producer Noah Shain. However, he ceased production of the album and began performing under the name Skrillex. After releasing the My Name is Skrillex EP for free download on his official MySpace page, he released the Scary Monsters and Nice Sprites EP in late-2010 and More Monsters and Sprites EP in mid-2011. Both have since become moderate commercial successes. On November 30, 2011, he was nominated for a total of five Grammy Awards at the 54th Grammy Awards, including Best New Artist and won three: \"Best Dance/Electronica Album,\" \"Best Dance Recording,\" and \"Best Remixed Recording, Non-Classical\". On December 5, 2011, the BBC announced that he had been nominated for their Sound of 2012 poll. On December 12, 2011, he was also named MTV's Electronic Dance Music Artist of the Year. \n\nBiography:\n\nBackground:\nMoore was born in the Highland Park neighborhood of Northeast Los Angeles, but moved to the Forest Hill neighborhood of San Francisco at the age of two, where he attended elementary school. At the ages of nine and ten, Moore attended a local boarding school located in the Mojave Desert LV, but eventually moved back to Northern California. By the age of twelve, his family moved him back to his birthplace of Northeast L.A., where he enrolled in a private academy school specializing in arts, and was then later home schooled at the age of fourteen due to bullying. In 2004, he learned he was adopted and dropped out of the program when he was sixteen years old. While a young teenager in Los Angeles, Moore would attend punk gigs in Mexican American neighborhoods in East and South Los Angeles, and later on electro club raves in the downtown's Silver Lake and Echo Park neighborhoods. \n\nFrom First to Last (2004-07):\nIn 2004, Moore contacted Matt Good of From First to Last about playing guitar for the band on their debut album. After flying out to Georgia, Moore was heard singing by three studio producers, Derrick Thomas, Eric Dale, and McHale Butler, and was then made lead singer, with Good playing guitar. In June 2004, Epitaph Records released the band's first full-length record with their new bandmate, Dear Diary, My Teen Angst Has a Body Count. After performing on several successful tours, two being the Vans Warped Tour and Dead by Dawn tour, they began recording their second album, Heroine with producer Ross Robinson. The album was released in March 2006 on Epitaph. With high record sales once again, the band found themselves part of many successful tours, until Moore started suffering vocal problems, causing the band to resign from several tours. After going through a successful vocal surgical procedure, Moore informed the band he would be permanently resigning to work on a solo career. FFTL's last show performed with Moore was in their hometown of Orlando at The House of Blues while touring with Atreyu. \n\nSolo career (2007-present):\n\nMoore announced he had left From First to Last to pursue a solo career. He then launched a Myspace page displaying three demos (\"Signal\", \"Equinox\", and \"Glow Worm\"). This led to Moore's first performance since his leaving From First to Last. On April 7, 2007, alongside harpist Carol Robbins, Moore played several original songs at a local art building. After months of releasing demos via Myspace, Moore played on the Team Sleep Tour with a full band. The tour also featured supporting acts Monster in the Machine and Strata. Moore made several demo CDs available on this tour, limited to about 30 per show. These CDs were tour exclusive, and were packaged in \"baby blue envelopes\", each with a unique drawing by Moore or bandmate. In February 2008, Alternative Press Magazine announced the second annual AP Tour, with All Time Low, The Rocket Summer, The Matches, and Forever the Sickest Kids, as well as Sonny Moore. The tour started in Houston, Texas on March 14 and went through North America, ending in Cleveland, Ohio on May 2, with the majority of the shows being sold out. All bands playing the tour would be featured on the cover of Alternative Press Magazine's annual 100 Bands You Need to Know special, and would be interviewed on the Alternative Press Podcast. During this tour Moore's line-up consisted of Sean Friday on drums, Christopher Null on guitar, and Aaron Rothe on keyboards. On April 7, 2009, he released Gypsyhook EP, a digital EP, which featured three songs and four remixes. Also included was a Japanese version of \"Mora\" entitled \"Êµ∑Ê∞¥\" (\"Kaisui\"). Physical copies of the EP were available at his shows. After going on tour with Innerpartysystem and Paper Route and opening for Chiodos on their European tour, Moore performed at Bamboozle on May 2. He performed on Bamboozle Left's Saints and Sinners stage on April 4. He toured with Hollywood Undead in April 2009 performing under the band name Sonny and the Blood Monkeys, with Chris Null (electric guitar), Sean Friday (drums, percussion & beats) and Aaron Rothe (keyboards, synthesizers, programming & turntables) Although no official statement has been given regarding the album, Moore has stated that Bells will no longer be released. \n\nProduction career:\n\nIn 2008, Moore began producing and performing under the alias Skrillex at clubs in the Los Angeles area. Previously, he had been known on the Internet as Twipz. On June 7, 2010, Moore released his official Skrillex debut EP, My Name is Skrillex as a free download. Moore provided programming and vocals for UK metalcore band Bring Me the Horizon on their third studio album, There Is a Hell, Believe Me I've Seen It. There Is a Heaven, Let's Keep It a Secret. Later in the year, Sonny began a nationwide tour with Deadmau5 after being signed to mau5trap recordings and released his second EP, Scary Monsters and Nice Sprites. Moore kicked off the \"Project Blue Book Tour\" in 2011 with support from Porter Robinson, Tommy Lee and DJ Aero as well as appearances from Sofia Toufa for a new song titled \"Bring out the Devil.\" Skrillex unveiled several new songs on this tour including \"First Of The Year\" (formerly known as \"Equinox\"), \"Reptile\", and \"Cinema\" (remix of a Benny Benassi track). \"Reptile\" was featured in the TV commercial for Mortal Kombat 9, and \"First of the Year (Equinox)\" is featured on his follow up EP and remix companion to Scary Monsters and Nice Sprites, titled More Monsters and Sprites. In April 2011, Spin magazine premiered \"Get Up\", an exclusive new track from Korn that was produced by Skrillex. Korn made \"Get Up\" available for free download via their Facebook page. On April 15, 2011 KoRn joined Skrillex on stage for his set at Coachella 2011. On April 18, 2011, Sony Computer Entertainment (SCEA) development studio Naughty Dog released a trailer for the multiplayer component of their PlayStation 3 game Uncharted 3: Drake's Deception, featuring \"Kill EVERYBODY\" from Scary Monsters and Nice Sprites. In June 2011, \"More Monsters and Sprites\" was released on Beatport, an EP consisting of three original tracks, including \"First of the Year (Equinox)\" and two versions of his original track \"Ruffneck\". A leaked track entitled \"Ruffneck Bass\" had been leaked on the internet months prior which used the same sample as in the new \"Ruffneck\" tracks on the EP. Skrillex released a music video for \"Rock n' Roll (Will Take You to the Mountain)\" on his official YouTube page on June 20, 2011. \n\nOn August 17, 2011 Skrillex announced his label, OWSLA. \"The label's first releases will come from Bristol-based dubstep producer Koan Sound, electro-house newcomer Porter Robinson from North Carolina, singer/songwriter Alvin Risk, and San Francisco-based M Machine (formally Metropolis).\" Skrillex released a music video for \"First of the Year (Equinox)\" via Spin.com on August 19, 2011. In late August 2011 it was released that he would be appearing Knife Party's first release, collaborating on a Moombahton style track entitled \"Zoology\". A preview was released on YouTube. In late September 2011 he created the track \"Syndicate\" as promotion for the video game of the same name. Kaskade's 2011 album Fire & Ice features a collaboration between Kaskade and Skrillex entitled \"Lick It\". The video for Skrillex's song \"First of the Year (Equinox)\" appears on the first episode of the Beavis and Butt-head revival. On November 8, Skrillex stated that he intended to release an album entitled Voltage. Skrillex gave fans more info about Voltage in RockSound Magazine after a photoshoot for the cover and doing an extensive interview on his tour. For unknown reasons, however, the album was never released. On December 21, 2011, Skrillex unveiled the Bangarang EP for a Beatport release on December 23. On March 13, 2012, Beatport released OWSLA's second Free Treats sampler, Free Treats Vol. 2. The 19-track compilation features \"Ruffneck (FULL Flex) Munchi Anonymous Revolution Remix\", a remixed track by Skrillex. This new take on the track deviates from the original (released on the More Monsters and Sprites EP), with the remix being more characteristic of Electro House, though with a much slower tempo of 108 BPM, versus the original version's classic Dubstep tempo of 140 BPM, also straying from the typical Electro House tempo of 128 BPM. On August 12, 2012, his new side-project formed with Boys Noize called Dog Blood released an EP called Next Order/Middle Finger. \n\nInfluences:\nMoore has stated in an online interview that he has been a longtime fan of Warp, an electronic music label that has released recordings from artists such as Aphex Twin and Squarepusher. \n\nPersonal life:\nAs of February 2012, Skrillex has been dating fellow artist and singer, Ellie Goulding, who provided vocals for the Skrillex track, \"Summit\", featured on the EP, Bangarang.",

                                "text": "Green Day is an American punk rock band formed in 1987. The band consists of lead vocalist and guitarist Billie Joe Armstrong, bassist and backing vocalist Mike Dirnt, and drummer Tre Cool. Cool replaced former drummer John Kiffmeyer in 1990, prior to the recording of the band's second studio album, Kerplunk (1992). Green Day was originally part of the punk scene at 924 Gilman Street in Berkeley, California. The band's early releases were from the independent record label Lookout! Records. In 1994, its major label debut Dookie released through Reprise Records became a breakout success and eventually sold over 10 million copies in the U.S. Green Day was widely credited, alongside fellow California punk bands Sublime,The Offspring and Rancid, with popularizing and reviving mainstream interest in punk rock in the United States. Green Day's three follow-up albums, Insomniac (1995), Nimrod (1997), and Warning (2000) did not achieve the massive success of Dookie, though they were still successful, with Insomniac and Nimrod reaching double platinum and Warning reaching gold status. The band's rock opera, American Idiot (2004), reignited the band's popularity with a younger generation, selling five million copies in the United States. The band's eighth studio album, 21st Century Breakdown, was released in 2009 which achieved the band's best chart performance to date. The band will begin to release a trilogy of albums called ¬°Uno!, ¬°Dos!, and ¬°Tr√©!, to be released September 25, 2012, November 13, 2012, and January 15, 2013 respectively. Green Day has sold over 65 million records worldwide with 25 million in the US alone. The group has won five Grammy Awards: Best Alternative Album for Dookie, Best Rock Album for American Idiot, Record of the Year for \"Boulevard of Broken Dreams\", Best Rock Album for the second time for 21st Century Breakdown and Best Musical Show Album for American Idiot: The Original Broadway Cast Recording. In 2010, a stage adaptation of American Idiot debuted on Broadway. The musical was nominated for several Tony Awards, including Best Musical and Best Scenic Design. \n\nHistory:\n\nFormation and Lookout! years (1987-1993):\nIn 1987, friends Billie Joe Armstrong and Mike Dirnt, 15 years old at the time, formed a band called Sweet Children. Its first live performance took place on October 17, 1987 at Rod's Hickory Pit in Vallejo, California. In 1988, Armstrong and Dirnt began working with Sean Hughes and the former Isocracy drummer John Kiffmeyer, also known as \"Al Sobrante\". As said in the film Punk's Not Dead, Armstrong cites the band Operation Ivy (which featured Tim Armstrong and Matt Freeman of Rancid) as a major influence, and a group that inspired him to form a band. In 1988, Larry Livermore, owner of Lookout! Records, saw the band play an early show and signed the group to his label. In 1989, the band recorded its debut extended play, 1,000 Hours. Before 1,000 Hours was released, the group dropped the name Sweet Children; according to Livermore, this was done to avoid confusion with another local band Sweet Baby. The band adopted the name Green Day, due to their fondness for marijuana. Lookout! would release Green Day's debut studio album, 39/Smooth in early 1990. Green Day would record two extended plays later that year, Slappy and Sweet Children, the latter of which included older songs that the band had recorded for the Minneapolis independent record label Skene! Records. In 1991, Lookout! Records re-released 39/Smooth under the name 1,039/Smoothed Out Slappy Hours, and added the songs from the band's first two EPs, Slappy, and 1,000 Hours. In late 1990, shortly after the band's first nationwide tour, Sobrante left the East Bay area to attend college.The Lookouts drummer Tre Cool began filling in as a temporary replacement and later Cool's position as Green Day's drummer became permanent. The band went on tour for most of 1992 and 1993, and played a number of shows overseas in Europe. The band's second studio album Kerplunk sold 50,000 copies in the U.S. \n\nBreakthrough success (1994-1996):\n\nKerplunk's underground success led to a number of major record labels being interested in signing Green Day, and the band eventually left Lookout! and signed to Reprise Records after attracting the attention of producer Rob Cavallo. The group was impressed by his work with fellow Californian band The Muffs, and later remarked that Cavallo \"was the only person we could really talk to and connect with\". Reflecting on the period, Armstrong told Spin magazine in 1999, \"I couldn't go back to the punk scene, whether we were the biggest success in the world or the biggest failure ... The only thing I could do was get on my bike and go forward.\" After signing with Reprise, the band went to work on recording its major label debut, Dookie. Recorded in three weeks, and released in February 1994,Dookie became a commercial success, helped by extensive MTV airplay for the videos of the songs \"Longview\", \"Basket Case\", and \"When I Come Around\", all of which reached the number one position on the Modern Rock Tracks charts. That year, Green Day embarked on a nationwide tour with queercore band Pansy Division as its opening act. At a September 9, 1994 performance at Hatch Memorial Shell in Boston, mayhem broke-out during the band's set (cut short to seven songs) and by the end of the rampage, 100 people were injured and 45 arrested. The band also joined the lineups of both the Lollapalooza festival and Woodstock '94, where they started an infamous mud fight. During the concert, a security guard mistook bassist Mike Dirnt for a stage-invading fan and punched out some of his teeth. Viewed by millions by pay-per-view television, the Woodstock 1994 performance further aided Green Day's growing publicity and recognition, and helped push its album to eventual diamond status. In 1995, Dookie won the Grammy Award for Best Alternative Album and the band was nominated for nine MTV Video Music Awards including Video of the Year. In 1995, a new single for the Angus soundtrack was released, entitled \"J.A.R.\". The single debuted at number one on the Billboard Modern Rock Tracks chart. The song was followed by the band's fourth studio album, Insomniac, which was released in the fall of 1995. Insomniac was a much darker and heavier response to the band's newfound popularity, compared to the more melodic Dookie. The album opened to a warm critical reception, earning 4 out of 5 stars from Rolling Stone, which said \"In punk, the good stuff actually unfolds and gains meaning as you listen without sacrificing any of its electric, haywire immediacy. And Green Day are as good as this stuff gets.\" The singles released from Insomniac were \"Geek Stink Breath\", \"Stuck with Me\", \"Brain Stew/Jaded\", and \"Walking Contradiction\". Though the album did not approach the success of Dookie, it sold two million copies in the United States. In addition, the album won the band award nominations for Favorite Artist, Favorite Hard Rock Artist, and Favorite Alternative Artist at the 1996 American Music Awards, and the video for \"Walking Contradiction\" got the band a Grammy nomination for Best Video, Short Form, in addition to a Best Special Effects nomination at the MTV Video Music Awards. After that, the band abruptly cancelled a European tour, citing exhaustion. \n\nMiddle years and decline in commercial success (1997-2002):\nAfter a brief hiatus in 1996, Green Day began to work on a new album in 1997. From the outset, both the band and Cavallo agreed that the album had to be different from its previous albums. The result was Nimrod, an experimental deviation from the band's standard pop-punk brand of music. The new album was released in October 1997. It provided a variety of music, from pop-punk, surf rock, and ska, to an acoustic ballad. Nimrod entered the charts at number 10. The success of \"Good Riddance (Time of Your Life)\" won the band an MTV Video Award for Best Alternative Video. The song was also used in the second \"clip show\" episode of Seinfeld and on two episodes of ER. The other singles released from Nimrod were \"Nice Guys Finish Last\", \"Hitchin' a Ride\" and \"Redundant\". The band made a guest appearance in an episode of King of the Hill entitled \"The Man Who Shot Cane Skretteberg\", which aired in 1997. In late 1997 and most of 1998, Green Day embarked on a tour in support of Nimrod. In 2000, Green Day released its sixth studio album Warning. In support of the album, the band participated in the Warped Tour in 2000. The band also had an independent tour to support the album in 2001. Critics' reviews of the album were varied.Allmusic gave it 4.5/5 saying \"Warning may not be an innovative record per se, but it's tremendously satisfying.\"Rolling Stone was more critical, giving it 3/5, and saying \"Warning... invites the question: Who wants to listen to songs of faith, hope and social commentary from what used to be snot-core's biggest-selling band?\" Though it produced the hit \"Minority\" and a smaller hit with \"Warning\", some observers were coming to the conclusion that the band was losing relevance, and a decline in popularity followed. While all of Green Day's previous albums had reached a status of at least double platinum, Warning was only certified gold. At the 2001 California Music Awards, Green Day won all eight of the awards that it was nominated for. The group won the awards for Outstanding Album (Warning), Outstanding Punk Rock/Ska Album (Warning), Outstanding Group, Outstanding Male Vocalist, Outstanding Bassist, Outstanding Drummer, Outstanding Songwriter, and Outstanding Artist. The release of two compilation albums, International Superhits! and Shenanigans, followed Warning. International Superhits and its companion collection of music videos, International Supervideos!. Shenanigans contained some of the band's b-sides, including \"Espionage\", which was featured in the film Austin Powers: The Spy Who Shagged Me and was nominated for a Grammy Award for Best Rock Instrumental Performance. In the spring of 2002, Green Day co-headlined the Pop Disaster Tour with Blink-182 which was documented on the DVD Riding in Vans with Boys. \n\nAmerican Idiot and renewed success (2003-2006):\n\nIn the summer of 2003, the band went into a studio to write and record new material for a new album, tentatively titled Cigarettes and Valentines. After completing 20 tracks, the master recordings were stolen from the studio. Instead of re-recording the stolen tracks, the band decided to abandon the entire project and start over, considering the material to be unrepresentative of the band's best work. It was then revealed that a band called The Network was signed to Armstrong's record label Adeline Records with little fanfare and information. After the mysterious band released an album called Money Money 2020, it was rumored that The Network was a Green Day side project, due to the similarities in the bands' sounds. However, these rumors were never addressed by the band or Adeline Records, except for a statement on the Adeline website discussing an ongoing dispute between the two bands. Green Day collaborated with Iggy Pop on two tracks for his album Skull Ring in November 2003. On February 1, 2004 a new song, a cover of \"I Fought the Law\" made its debut on a commercial for iTunes during NFL Super Bowl XXXVIII. \n\nThe resulting album, American Idiot (2004), debuted at number one on the Billboard charts, the band's first album to reach number one, backed by the success of the album's first single, American Idiot. The album was labeled as a punk rock opera which follows the journey of the fictitious Jesus of Suburbia.American Idiot won the 2005 Grammy for Best Rock Album. The band also won a total of seven awards out of eight awards for which they were nominated, including the Viewer's Choice Award in MTV Video Music Awards 2005. Through 2005, the band toured in support of the album with nearly 150 dates (Longest tour in their career) visiting Japan, Australia, South America and the United Kingdom. While touring for American Idiot, they filmed and recorded the two concerts at the Milton Keynes National Bowl in England, which was voted 'The Best Show On Earth' in a Kerrang! Magazine Poll. These recordings were released as a live CD and DVD called Bullet in a Bible on November 15, 2005. This CD/DVD featured songs from American Idiot as well as songs from all its previous albums, except Kerplunk and 1,039/Smoothed Out Slappy Hours. The DVD featured behind-the-scenes footage of the band, and showed how the band prepared to put on the show. The final shows of its 2005 world tour were in Sydney and Melbourne in Australia, on December 14 and 17 respectively. On August 1, 2005, Green Day announced that it had rescinded the master rights to its pre-Dookie material from Lookout! Records, citing a continuing breach of contract regarding unpaid royalties, a complaint shared with other Lookout! bands. On January 10, 2006 the band was awarded with a People's Choice Award as favorite musical group or band. \n\n21st Century Breakdown and American Idiot: The Musical (2006-2010):\nGreen Day engaged in a number of other smaller projects in the time following the success of American Idiot. The group released an album under the name Foxboro Hot Tubs entitled Stop Drop and Roll!!!. In 2008, the Foxboro Hot Tubs went on a mini-tour to promote the record, hitting tiny Bay Area venues including the Stork Club in Oakland and Toot's Tavern in Crockett, CA. \n\nIn an interview with Carson Daly, Garbage lead singer Shirley Manson revealed that Butch Vig would be producing Green Day's forthcoming album. The span of nearly five years between American Idiot and 21st Century Breakdown was the longest gap between studio albums in Green Day's career. The band had been working on new material since January 2006. By October 2007, Armstrong had 45 songs written, but the band showed no further signs of progress until October 2008, when two videos showing the band recording in the studio with producer Butch Vig were posted on YouTube. The writing and recording process, spanning three years and four recording studios, was finally finished in April 2009. 21st Century Breakdown, was released on May 15, 2009. The album received a mainly positive reception from critics, getting an average rating between 3 and 4 stars. After the release, the album reached number one in fourteen countries, being certified gold or platinum in each. 21st Century Breakdown achieved Green Day's best chart performance to date. The band started playing shows in California in April and early May. It was their first live show in about three years. Green Day went on a world tour that started in North America in July 2009 and continuing around the world throughout the rest of 2009 and early 2010.Wal-Mart refused to carry the album as it contains a Parental Advisory sticker and requested that Green Day release a censored edition. The band members did not wish to change any lyrics on the album and responded by stating, \"There's nothing dirty about our record... They want artists to censor their records in order to be carried in there. We just said no. We've never done it before. You feel like you're in 1953 or something.\" In 2009, the band met with award-winning director Michael Mayer and many cast and crew members of the Tony Award-winning musical Spring Awakening to create a stage version of the album American Idiot.American Idiot: The Musical opened in the Berkeley Repertory Theatre during the end of 2009. The show features an expanded story of the original album, with new characters such as Will, Extraordinary Girl, and Favorite Son. On April 20, 2010, American Idiot: The Musical opened on Broadway, and Green Day released the soundtrack to the musical, featuring a new song by Green Day entitled \"When It's Time\". In June 2010 the iTunes received the single \"When It's Time\". During the Spike TV Video Game Awards 2009, it was announced that Green Day was set to have its own Rock Band video game titled as Green Day: Rock Band, as a follow-up to the last band specific Rock Band game, The Beatles: Rock Band. The game features the full albums of Dookie, American Idiot, and 21st Century Breakdown as well as select songs from the rest of Green Day's discography. During the second leg of the 21st Century Breakdown World Tour the band had said that they are writing new material. In an interview with Kerrang! magazine, Armstrong spoke about the possible new album: \"We did some demos in Berlin, some in Stockholm, some just outside of Glasgow and some in Amsterdam. We wanted get the songs down in some early form.\" The band also stated that they were recording a live album during the entire tour on the last date of the tour in Mountain View, California, also before playing the song \"Cigarettes and Valentines\". In October 2010, Dirnt was interviewed by Radio W, mentioning that they have completed the writing process of the ninth studio album. In the interview, Dirnt also mentioned that a new live album will \"most likely\" be released. The live CD/DVD and CD/Blu-ray entitled Awesome as Fuck was released on March 22, 2011. \n\n¬°Uno!, ¬°Dos!, and ¬°Tr√©! (2011-present):\nOn August 11, 2011, Green Day played a secret show in Costa Mesa, California, and performed an entire set of over 15 new songs allegedly for a possible upcoming album. Green Day put a news post on their official website which read \"Thanks everyone for coming out to the show...\" and \"Stay tuned for more\". It also included lyrics to a new song that was played at the show called \"Amy\" which is dedicated to Amy Winehouse, who died weeks before the show. In February 2012, Armstrong announced through Twitter that the band were in the studio, recording material for a new album. On February 24, 2012, the band began uploading behind the scenes videos of the recording of the new album to YouTube. On April 11, singer Billie Joe Armstrong announced that Green Day would be releasing a trilogy of albums called ¬°Uno!, ¬°Dos!, and ¬°Tr√©!. Armstrong stated that they would be released on September 25, 2012, November 13, 2012, and January 15, 2013 respectively. On June 14, 2012, Green Day released the official artwork of the album ¬°Uno! on YouTube and Facebook. Armstrong in a talk with Rolling Stone Magazine confirmed that each album will have a member of the band on its cover. The ¬°Uno! ¬°Dos! ¬°Tr√©! Ultimate Box Set has also been announced by Warner Bros. Records and will contain all three albums, as well as various other content, such as three digital singles and a one year online membership or renewal to the Idiot Club. The band played at the Rock En Seine festival in France on August 24-26, 2012, the Rock am See festival in Germany on September 1, 2012 and the Reading festival in the UK. The band has also announced a US tour supporting the trilogy, from November 2012 through February 2013. ¬°Uno! was released on September 24, 2012 and has been met with generally favorable reviews. \n\nMusical style and influences:\n\nGreen Day's sound is often compared to first wave punk bands such as the Ramones, The Clash, Sex Pistols, and the Buzzcocks. Citing the band's musical style prevalent on Dookie, Stephen Erlewine of Allmusic described Green Day as \"punk revivalists who recharged the energy of speedy, catchy three-chord punk-pop songs.\" While Armstrong is the primary songwriter, he looks to the other band members for organizational help. Billie Joe Armstrong has mentioned that some of his biggest influences are seminal alternative rock bands H√ºsker D√º and The Replacements, and that their influence is particularly noted in the band's chord changes in songs. Green Day has covered H√ºsker D√º's \"Don't Want to Know If You Are Lonely\" as a b-side to the \"Warning\" single, and the character \"Mr. Whirly\" in their song \"Misery\" is a reference to the Replacements song of the same name. Among other influences, Green Day have also cited The Who and power pop pioneers Cheap Trick. The band has generated controversy over whether the band's musical style and major-label status constitutes as \"true punk\". In reaction to both the style of music and the background of the band, John Lydon, former front man of the 1970s punk band the Sex Pistols commented: \n\"So there we are fending off all that and it pisses me off that years later a wank outfit like Green Day hop in and nick all that and attach it to themselves. They didn't earn their wings to do that and if they were true punk they wouldn't look anything like they do.\" \nArmstrong himself has discussed the group's status of being a punk band on a major record label, saying \"Sometimes I think we've become totally redundant because we're this big band now, we've made a lot of money - we're not punk rock any more. But then I think about it and just say, 'You can take us out of a punk rock environment, but you can't take the punk rock out of us.'\" English rock musician Noel Gallagher of Oasis also complained about the band semi-jokingly, claiming that they ripped off his song \"Wonderwall\" with their song \"Boulevard of Broken Dreams\". \n\nRelated projects:\nSince 1991, members of the band have branched out past Green Day and have started other projects with other musicians. Notable related projects of Green Day include Billie Joe Armstrong's Pinhead Gunpowder (which also features Green Day's live back-up guitarist Jason White), The Frustrators in which Mike Dirnt plays bass, and The Network, a collaboration between Green Day and members of the band, Devo in which all members play under fake stage names. Green Day has also released an album titled Stop Drop and Roll!!! on May 20, 2008, under the name Foxboro Hot Tubs, they currently use this name to book secret shows. In late December 2011, Armstrong formed a new side band called The Boo along his wife Adrienne and their two sons. In September 2006, Green Day collaborated with U2 and producer Rick Rubin to record a cover of the song \"The Saints Are Coming\", originally recorded by The Skids, with an accompanying video. The song was recorded to benefit Music Rising, an organization to help raise money for musicians' instruments lost during Hurricane Katrina, and to bring awareness on the eve of the one year anniversary of the disaster. In December 2006, Green Day and NRDC opened a web site in partnership to raise awareness on America's dependency on oil. Green Day released a cover of the John Lennon song \"Working Class Hero\", which was featured on the album Instant Karma: The Amnesty International Campaign to Save Darfur. The band performed the song on the season finale of American Idol. The song was nominated for a Grammy Award in 2008, though lost to The White Stripes' \"Icky Thump\". That summer, the band appeared in a cameo role in The Simpsons Movie, where they perform the show's theme song. Their version was released as a single on July 24, 2007. In 2009, the band collaborated with theatre director Michael Mayer to adapt their rock opera American Idiot into a one-act stage musical that premiered at the Berkeley Rep on September 15, 2009. The show then moved to Broadway on April 20, 2010. The reviews of American Idiot: The Musical have been positive to mixed. Charles Isherwood of The New York Times wrote an enthusiastic review for the Broadway production. He called the show \"a pulsating portrait of wasted youth that invokes all the standard genre conventions ... only to transcend them through the power of its music and the artistry of its execution, the show is as invigorating and ultimately as moving as anything I've seen on Broadway this season. Or maybe for a few seasons past.\" Jed Gottlieb of the Boston Herald enjoyed the premise of the show but found that \"the music and message suffer in a setting where the audience is politely, soberly seated\". Michael Kuchiwara of the Associated Press found the show to be \"visually striking and musically adventurous\", but noted that \"the show has the barest wisp of a story and minimal character development\". Paul Kolnik in USA Today enjoyed the contradiction that Green Day's \"massively popular, starkly disenchanted album ... would be the feel-good musical of the season\". Time magazine's Richard Zoglin opined that the score \"is as pure a specimen of contemporary punk rock as Broadway has yet encountered yet there's enough variety. ... Where the show fall short is as a fully developed narrative.\" He concluded that \"American Idiot, despite its earnest huffing and puffing, remains little more than an annotated rock concert. ... Still, it deserves at least two cheers - for its irresistible musical energy and for opening fresh vistas for that odd couple, rock and Broadway.\" Peter Travers from Rolling Stone, in his review of American Idiot, wrote \"Though American Idiot carries echoes of such rock musicals as Tommy, Hair, Rent and Spring Awakening, it cuts its own path to the heart. You won't know what hit you. American Idiot knows no limits--it's a global knockout.\" The musical has been nominated for a number of Tony Awards, including Best Musical and Best Scenic Design. It was also nominated for a number of Drama Desk Awards and Outer Critics Circle Awards. In October 2009, a Green Day art project was exhibited at StolenSpace Gallery in London. The exhibition showed artworks created for each of the songs on 21st Century Breakdown, was supported by the band, and led by their manager Pat Magnarella. He explained in an interview that \"Artists are basically like rock bands. Most are creating their art, but don't know how to promote it.\" For Billie Joe Armstrong, \"Many of the artists... show their work on the street, and we feel a strong connection to that type of creative expression.\" On April 13, 2011, a film version of American Idiot was confirmed. Michael Mayer, director of the Broadway musical, will be directing the film. It will be produced by Green Day, Pat Magnarella (Green Day's manager who also produced Bullet in a Bible, Awesome as Fuck, and Heart Like a Hand Grenade), Playtone (Tom Hanks and Gary Goetzman) and Tom Hulce. \n\nInvolvement in politics and social justice:\nWhen asked his opinion regarding whether all musicians ought to try to add a social or political message to their work, Armstrong replied that \" \nThe only people who should sing about social issues or politics are the ones who aren't full of shit. \n\" \n American Idiot was released two months before former President of the United States George W. Bush was reelected, and as a result the album became protest art. Created as an anti-war album, American Idiot contains many new-age protest songs, like Holiday which was against George Bush's decision to invade Iraq. Armstrong described the song as a means by which \"to battle your way out of your own ignorance\". \n\nBand members:\n\nCurrent members \nBillie Joe Armstrong - lead vocals, guitar, piano, harmonica (1987-present), \nMike Dirnt - bass, backing vocals (1988-present), rhythm guitar (1987-1988), \nTr√© Cool - drums, percussion, backing vocals (1990-present), \nSession and touring members \nJason White - lead and rhythm guitars, backing vocals (1999-present), \nJason Freese - keyboards, piano, saxophone, trombone, backing vocals (2003-present), \nJeff Matika - rhythm guitar, acoustic guitar, backing vocals (2009-present), \n\nFormer members \nJohn Kiffmeyer - drums, percussion (1987-1990), \nSean Hughes - bass (1987-1988), \nFormer touring members \nTimmy Chunks - guitars (1997-1999), \nGarth Schultz - trombone, trumpet (1997-1999), \nGabrial McNair - trombone, tenor saxophone (1999-2001), \nJeanne Geiger - trombone (2001), \nKurt Lohmiller - trumpet, timpani, percussion, backing vocals (1999-2004), \nMike Pelino - rhythm guitar, backing vocals (2004-2005), \nRonnie Blake - trumpet, timpani, percussion, backing vocals (2004-2005)",

                                "text": "Green Day is an American rock trio formed in 1987. The band has consisted of Billie Joe Armstrong (vocals, guitar), Mike Dirnt (bass guitar, vocals), and Tr√© Cool (drums, percussion) for the majority of its existence.  Green Day was originally part of the punk rock scene at 924 Gilman Street, Berkeley in  East Bay, CA, United States . Its early releases for independent record label Lookout! Records earned them a grassroots fanbase, some of whom felt alienated when the band signed to a major label. Nevertheless, its major label debut Dookie (1994) became a breakout success and eventually sold over 10 million copies in the US. and 15 million worldwide. As a result, Green Day was widely credited, alongside fellow California punk bands The Offspring and Rancid, with reviving mainstream interest in and popularizing punk rock in the United States. Green Day's three follow-up albums, Insomniac, Nimrod and Warning did not achieve the massive success of Dookie, but they were still successful, reaching double platinum, double platinum, and gold status respectively. Green Day's 2004 rock opera American Idiot reignited the band's popularity with a younger generation, selling five million copies in the U.S.The band's eighth studio album, 21st Century Breakdown, was released on May 15, 2009.  Green Day has sold over 22 million records in the United States.They have won three Grammy Awards; Best Alternative Album for Dookie, Best Rock Album for American Idiot, and Record of the Year for Boulevard of Broken Dreams.  In 1987, friends Billie Joe Armstrong and Mike Dirnt, 15 years old at the time, formed a band called Sweet Children. The first Sweet Children show took place on October 17, 1987, at Rod's Hickory Pit in Vallejo, California where Armstrong's mother was working.In 1988, Armstrong and Dirnt began working with former Isocracy drummer, John Kiffmeyer (also known as Al Sobrante). Kiffmeyer served as both the band's drummer and business manager, handling the booking of shows and helping the band establish a fan base.  Larry Livermore, owner of Lookout! Records, saw the band play an early show and signed them to his label. In 1989 they recorded their first EP, 1,000 Hours. Before 1,000 Hours was released, the band dropped the name Sweet Children, according to Livermore this was done in order to avoid confusion with another local band Sweet Baby.The band adopted the name Green Day, allegedly due to their fondness of marijuana.  Lookout! would release Green Day's first LP, 39/Smooth in early 1990. Green Day would record two EPs later that year: Slappy and Sweet Children, the latter of which included some older songs they had recorded for Minneapolis indie label Skene! Records. In 1991, Lookout! Records released 1,039/Smoothed Out Slappy Hours, a compilation of the 39/Smooth, Slappy, and 1,000 Hours EPs. In late 1990, shortly after the band's first nationwide tour, Sobrante left the East Bay area to attend college. The Lookouts drummer Tr√© Cool began filling in as a temporary replacement, and when it became clear that Sobrante did not plan on committing to the band full time, Tr√© Cool's position as Green Day's drummer became permanent. The band went on tour for most of 1992 and 1993, and played a stretch of shows overseas in Europe. The band's second full length album Kerplunk sold about 50,000 copies in the U.S., which was considered quite a large amount for the independent punk scene in 1992.  Kerplunk's underground success led to a wave of interest coming from major record labels, and eventually they left Lookout! on friendly terms and signed with Reprise Records after attracting the attention of producer Rob Cavallo. Signing to Reprise caused many punk rock fans to regard Green Day as sellouts.Reflecting on the period, Armstrong told SPIN magazine in 1999, \"I couldn't go back to the punk scene, whether we were the biggest success in the world or the biggest failure ... The only thing I could do was get on my bike and go forward.\" After signing with Reprise, the band went to work on recording its major label debut, Dookie.  \"Longview\" Play sound Sample of \"Longview\", the first single from Dookie, which combined a memorable bass line with a guitar riff and drums introduced in the chorus. Problems listening to this file? See media help.  \"Basket Case\" Play sound Sample of \"Basket Case\", the third single from Dookie, which was about Armstrong's panic attacks. Problems listening to this file? See media help.  Released in February 1994, and recorded in 3 weeks,Dookie became a commercial success, helped by extensive MTV airplay for the videos of the songs \"Longview\", \"Basket Case\", and \"When I Come Around\", all of which reached the number one position on the Modern Rock Tracks charts. That year, Green Day embarked on a nationwide tour with queercore band Pansy Division as its opening act. At a September 9, 1994 concert at Boston Esplanade, mayhem broke-out during the band's set (cut short to seven songs) and by the end of the rampage, 100 people were injured and 45 arrested. The band also joined the lineups of both the Lollapalooza festival and Woodstock 1994, where they started an infamous mud fight. During the concert, a security guard mistook bassist Mike Dirnt for a stage-invading fan and punched out some of his teeth. Viewed by millions via pay-per-view television, the Woodstock 1994 performance further aided Green Day's growing publicity and recognition, and helped push its album to eventual diamond status. In 1995, Dookie won the Grammy Award for Best Alternative Album and the band was nominated for 9 MTV Video Music Awards including Video of the Year. The full fold-out artwork to Insomniac, entitled God Told Me to Skin You Alive.  In 1995, a new single for the Angus soundtrack was released, titled \"J.A.R.\". The single went straight to number one on the Billboard Modern Rock Tracks chart. The song was followed by the band's new album, Insomniac, which was released in the fall of 1995. Insomniac was a much darker and heavier response by the band, compared to the poppier, more melodic Dookie. Insomniac opened to a warm critical reception, earning 4 out of 5 stars from Rolling Stone, which said \"In punk, the good stuff actually unfolds and gains meaning as you listen without sacrificing any of its electric, haywire immediacy. And Green Day are as good as this stuff gets.\"Insomniac used a piece of art by Winston Smith entitled God Told Me to Skin You Alive for its album cover. The singles released from Insomniac were \"Geek Stink Breath\", \"Brain Stew/Jaded\", \"Walking Contradiction\", and \"Stuck With Me\". Though the album did not approach the success of Dookie, it still sold two million copies in the United States.Insomniac won the band award nominations for Favorite Artist, Favorite Hard Rock Artist, and Favorite Alternative Artist at the 1996 American Music Awards, and the video for \"Walking Contradiction\" got the band a Grammy nomination for Best Video, Short Form, in addition to a Best Special Effects nomination at the MTV Video Music Awards.[20] After that, the band abruptly cancelled a European tour, citing exhaustion.  Middle era: 1997-2002  After taking a break in 1996, Green Day began to work on a new album in 1997. From the outset, both the band and Cavallo agreed that the album had to be different from its previous records.The result was Nimrod, an experimental deviation from the band's standard pop-punk brand of music. The new album was released in October 1997. It provided a variety of music, from pop-punk, surf rock, and ska, to an acoustic ballad. Nimrod entered the charts at number 10. The success of \"Good Riddance (Time of Your Life)\" won the band an MTV Video Award for Best Alternative Video for the song's video, which depicted people undergoing major changes in their lives while Billie Joe Armstrong strummed his acoustic guitar. The song was also used in the second \"clip show\" episode of Seinfeld and on two episodes of ER. The other singles released from Nimrod were \"Nice Guys Finish Last\", \"Hitchin' a Ride\" and \"Redundant\". The band made a guest appearance in an episode of King of the Hill entitled \"The Man Who Shot Cane Skretteberg\", which aired in 1997.  In 2000, Green Day released Warning, a step further in the style that they had hinted at with Nimrod. Critics' reviews of the album were varied.Allmusic gave it 4.5/5 saying \"Warning may not be an innovative record per se, but it's tremendously satisfying.\" Rolling Stone was more critical, giving it 3/5, and saying \"Warning... invites the question: Who wants to listen to songs of faith, hope and social commentary from what used to be snot-core's biggest-selling band?\" Though it produced the hit \"Minority\" and a smaller hit with \"Warning\", some observers were coming to the conclusion that the band was losing relevance,and a decline in popularity followed. While all of Green Day's past albums had reached a status of at least double platinum, Warning was only certified gold.  At the 2001 California Music Awards, Green Day won all eight awards that they were nominated for. They won the awards for Outstanding Album (Warning), Outstanding Punk Rock/Ska Album (Warning), Outstanding Group, Outstanding Male Vocalist, Outstanding Bassist, Outstanding Drummer, Outstanding Songwriter and Outstanding Artist  The release of a Greatest Hits compilation, International Superhits!, and an assemblage of B-sides, Shenanigans, followed Warning. International Superhits and its companion collection of music videos, International Supervideos!, sold reasonably well, going platinum in the U.S. Shenanigans contained some of the band's b-sides, including \"Espionage\" which was featured in Austin Powers: The Spy Who Shagged Me and was nominated for a Grammy for Best Rock Instrumental Performance.  In the spring of 2002, Green Day co-headlined the Pop Disaster Tour with Blink-182. Despite the co-headlining title, Green Day would play each show before Blink-182, who at the time were experiencing more success. The tour was documented on the DVD Riding In Vans With Boys.  American Idiot and renewed popularity: 2003-2006 Spectators watch Green Day from the grass slopes at the National Bowl.  In the summer of 2003 the band went into a studio to write and record new material for a new album, tentatively titled Cigarettes and Valentines. After completing 20 tracks, the master tapes were stolen from the studio. The band chose not to try to re-create the stolen album, but instead started over. By the end of 2003, Green Day collaborated with Iggy Pop on two tracks for his album Skull Ring. On February 1, 2004 a new song, a cover of \"I Fought the Law\" made its debut on a commercial for iTunes during NFL Super Bowl XXXVIII. The band underwent serious \"band therapy,\" engaging in several long talks to work out the members' differences after accusations from Dirnt and Cool that Armstrong was \"the band's Nazi\" and a show-off bent on taking the limelight from the other band members.  The resulting 2004 album, American Idiot, debuted at number one on the Billboard charts, the band's first ever album to top the chart, backed by the success of the album's first single, \"American Idiot.\" The album was billed as a \"punk rock opera\" which follows the journey of the fictitious \"Jesus of Suburbia\". American Idiot won the 2005 Grammy for \"Best Rock Album\" and the band swept the 2005 MTV music awards, winning a total of seven of the eight awards they were nominated for, including the coveted Viewer's Choice Award.  Through 2005, the band toured in support of the album with about 150 dates -- the longest tour in its career -- visiting Japan, Australia, South America and the United Kingdom, where they drew a crowd of 130,000 people over a span of two days. While touring for American Idiot, they filmed and recorded the two concerts at the Milton Keynes National Bowl in England, which was voted 'The Best Show On Earth' in a Kerrang! Magazine Poll.  These recordings were released as a live CD and DVD called Bullet in a Bible on November 15, 2005. This CD/DVD featured hits from American Idiot as well as a few songs from all its previous albums, except \"Kerplunk\" and \"1,039/Smoothed Out Slappy Hours\". The DVD featured behind-the-scenes footage of the band, and showed how the band prepared to put on the show. The final shows of its 2005 world tour were in Sydney, Australia, and Melbourne, Australia, on December 14 and 17 respectively. On January 10, 2006 the band was awarded with a People's Choice Award for favorite group. Green Day live in Germany during the American Idiot tour.  On August 1, 2005, Green Day announced that that it had rescinded the master rights to its pre-Dookie material from Lookout! Records, citing a continuing breach of contract regarding unpaid royalties, a complaint shared with other Lookout! bands. The pre-Dookie material, which remained out of print for about a year, was reissued by the band's current label, Reprise, on January 9, 2007.  In 2006, Green Day won the Grammy Award for Record of the Year for \"Boulevard of Broken Dreams\" which spent 16 weeks at the number one position of Billboard's Modern Rock Tracks, a record it shared along with Red Hot Chili Peppers' \"Scar Tissue\" and Staind's \"It's Been Awhile,\" (the record has been since been beaten by Foo Fighters' 2007 hit \"The Pretender\" which reigned at the top spot for 18 weeks).  Foxboro Hot Tubs and 21st Century Breakdown: 2007 onward  Green Day engaged in several other smaller projects in the time following the hype of American Idiot. In the spring of 2007, Green Day recorded a cover of the John Lennon song \"Working Class Hero\", which appeared on a compilation album \"Instant Karma\", that benefitted victims in Darfur. In the summer of 2007, Green Day recorded a version of The Simpsons theme song for The Simpsons Movie, as well as having an appearance in the movie.  Green Day recently released a new album under the name Foxboro Hot Tubs entitled Stop Drop and Roll!!!. In an interview with Kerrang!, Billie Joe revealed that 2008 would \"be a fair estimate of the release date of their new untitled eighth studio album.\"In a recent interview with Carson Daly, Garbage lead singer Shirley Manson revealed that Butch Vig would be producing Green Day's forthcoming album. In October 2008 Green Day returned to the studios with Butch Vig, to start recording the new studio album. Two videos showing the band in the studio were posted on YouTube. In the tour section of the band's official website, the message \"World Tour coming soon!\" is shown.In the December 9 issue of Alternative Press, in-depth details about the new album were released. According to the interview, Green Day are recording in the same studio as they did for American Idiot, Ocean Way Recording in Hollywood, California. \"This album is more... religious\", and is influenced by Bob Dylan, Bruce Springsteen, and The Beatles, to name a few.Billie Joe Armstrong said when he was being interviewed for Kerrang!'s readers poll, that it will be more power pop than punk rock.The new album is titled 21st Century Breakdown and was released worldwide on May 15, 2009. Green Day will be going on a world tour starting with North America in July, 2009 until sometime in 2010. Singles from 21st Century Breakdown include Know Your Enemy and 21 Guns.  Musical style and influences  Green Day's sound is often compared to first wave punk bands such as the Ramones, The Clash, Sex Pistols, The Jam, and the Buzzcocks. The majority of their song catalog is composed of distorted guitar, fast, manic drums, and relatively high-treble bass. Most of their songs are fast-paced and under four minutes. Billie Joe Armstrong has mentioned that some of his biggest influences are seminal alternative rock bands H√ºsker D√º and The Replacements, and that their influence is particularly noted in the band's chord changes in songs. In fact, Green Day has covered H√ºsker D√º's \"Don't Want to Know If You Are Lonely\" as a b-side for the \"Warning\" single, and the character \"Mr. Whirly\" in their song \"Misery\" is a reference to the Replacements song of the same name. Among other influences, Green Day have also cited Queen,proto-punks The Who, and power pop pioneers Cheap Trick [46]. Armstrong's lyrics commonly describe alienation, (\"Jesus of Suburbia\", \"Boulevard of Broken Dreams\", \"Road to Acceptance\", \"Disappearing Boy\", \"Castaway\") hysteria (\"Basket Case\", \"Panic Song\"), girls (\"She\", \"80\" \"Only of You\",\"Maria\" \"She's a Rebel\"), growing up (\"Longview\" and \"Welcome to Paradise\"), and the effects of doing drugs (\"Geek Stink Breath\", \"Green Day\"). The Ramones had similar lyrical themes such as hysteria (\"Anxiety\", \"Psycho Therapy\"), alienation (\"Outsider\", \"Something To Believe In\"), girls (\"I Wanna Be Your Boyfriend\", \"Sheena Is a Punk Rocker\"), and drugs (\"Now I Wanna Sniff Some Glue\", \"Chinese Rocks\"). Green Day has covered Ramones songs several times, including recording \"Outsider\" for the tribute album We're a Happy Family, and performing \"Blitzkrieg Bop\" and \"Teenage Lobotomy\" when the Ramones were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2002.  Criticism and controversy  Beginning with the release of Dookie, and the subsequent explosion of MTV airplay it received, Green Day has received considerable criticism from those who see the punk genre as a social movement independent of corporate sponsorship. With the release of American Idiot and the subsequent draw of many new fans, much of this criticism has been revived.  One of the more contentious issues is genre labeling. In reaction to both the style of music and the background of the band, many fans and musicians have taken heavy objection to the usage of the term \"punk\" when applied to Green Day. This is evidenced by the following comments issued by John Lydon (Johnny Rotten), former front man of both the 1970s punk band the Sex Pistols and the 1980s post-punk, Public Image Ltd.: \" So there we are fending off all that and it pisses me off that years later a wank outfit like Green Day hop in and nick all that and attach it to themselves. They didn't earn their wings to do that and if they were true punk they wouldn't look anything like they do. \"  Brandon Flowers of The Killers went on record in 2007 claiming that Green Day's politically driven concept album American Idiot displays \"calculated Anti-Americanism.\" He explained that he has problems with the album content itself and also the fact that the band's recent live DVD, Bullet in a Bible, was filmed in England. The taping of the concert, featured on Bullet in a Bible, shows thousands of Europeans singing along to \"American Idiot.\" Stating that he felt Green Day's DVD is a bit of a stunt, he said, \"I just thought it was really cheap. To go to a place like England or Germany and sing that song - those kids aren't taking it the same way that he meant it. And he (Billie Joe Armstrong) knew it.\"  More recently, Oasis guitarist Noel Gallagher has accused the band of ripping off his song \"Wonderwall\" for \"Boulevard of Broken Dreams\".  Related projects Main article: Green Day related projects  Ever since 1991, some members of the band have branched out past Green Day and have started other projects with other musicians. Notable related projects of Green Day include Billie Joe Armstrong's Pinhead Gunpowder (which also features Green Day's live backup guitarist Jason White), The Frustrators in which Mike Dirnt plays bass, and The Network, in which all three members of Green Day play under fake stage names. Billie Joe Armstrong has also confirmed that the main members of Green Day are in the band Foxboro Hot Tubs. A Foxboro Hot Tubs album titled Stop Drop and Roll!!! was released on 2008-05-20.  Charity projects that the band have been involved with include the collaboration with U2 (\"The Saints Are Coming\") to help raise money for musical instruments lost in Hurricane Katrina, and teaming with the Natural Resources Defense Council for the \"Move America Beyond Oil\" campaign and other environmental concerns.  In September 2006, Green Day teamed up with U2 and producer Rick Rubin to record a cover of the song \"The Saints Are Coming\", originally recorded by The Skids, with an accompanying video. The song is to benefit Music Rising, an organization to help raise money for musicians' instruments lost during Hurricane Katrina, and to bring awareness on the eve of the one year anniversary of the disaster.  \"Working Class Hero\" Play sound \"Working Class Hero\", a cover of a John Lennon song, was released on the Instant Karma CD. Problems listening to this file? See media help.  In December 2006, Green Day and NRDC opened a web site in partnership to raise awareness on America's dependency on oil. (See related projects.)  Green Day released a cover of the John Lennon song \"Working Class Hero\", that was featured on the album Instant Karma: The Amnesty International Campaign to Save Darfur. The band performed the song on the season finale of American Idol. The song was nominated for a Grammy in 2008, but lost to The White Stripes' \"Icky Thump\".  That summer, the band appeared in a cameo role in The Simpsons Movie, where they perform the show's theme song. Their version was released as a single on July 24, 2007.

                                "text": "Green Day is an American punk rock band formed in 1987. The band consists of lead vocalist and guitarist Billie Joe Armstrong, bassist and backing vocalist Mike Dirnt, and drummer Tre Cool. Cool replaced former drummer John Kiffmeyer in 1990, prior to the recording of the band's second studio album, Kerplunk (1992). Green Day was originally part of the punk scene at 924 Gilman Street in Berkeley, California. The band's early releases were from the independent record label Lookout! Records. In 1994, its major label debut Dookie released through Reprise Records became a breakout success and eventually sold over 10 million copies in the U.S. Green Day was widely credited, alongside fellow California punk bands Sublime,The Offspring and Rancid, with popularizing and reviving mainstream interest in punk rock in the United States. Green Day's three follow-up albums, Insomniac (1995), Nimrod (1997), and Warning (2000) did not achieve the massive success of Dookie, though they were still successful, with Insomniac and Nimrod reaching double platinum and Warning reaching gold status. The band's rock opera, American Idiot (2004), reignited the band's popularity with a younger generation, selling five million copies in the United States. The band's eighth studio album, 21st Century Breakdown, was released in 2009 which achieved the band's best chart performance to date. The band will begin to release a trilogy of albums called ¬°Uno!, ¬°Dos!, and ¬°Tr√©!, to be released September 25, 2012, November 13, 2012, and January 15, 2013 respectively. Green Day has sold over 65 million records worldwide with 25 million in the US alone. The group has won five Grammy Awards: Best Alternative Album for Dookie, Best Rock Album for American Idiot, Record of the Year for \"Boulevard of Broken Dreams\", Best Rock Album for the second time for 21st Century Breakdown and Best Musical Show Album for American Idiot: The Original Broadway Cast Recording. In 2010, a stage adaptation of American Idiot debuted on Broadway. The musical was nominated for several Tony Awards, including Best Musical and Best Scenic Design. \n\nHistory:\n\nFormation and Lookout! years (1987-1993):\nIn 1987, friends Billie Joe Armstrong and Mike Dirnt, 15 years old at the time, formed a band called Sweet Children. Its first live performance took place on October 17, 1987 at Rod's Hickory Pit in Vallejo, California. In 1988, Armstrong and Dirnt began working with Sean Hughes and the former Isocracy drummer John Kiffmeyer, also known as \"Al Sobrante\". As said in the film Punk's Not Dead, Armstrong cites the band Operation Ivy (which featured Tim Armstrong and Matt Freeman of Rancid) as a major influence, and a group that inspired him to form a band. In 1988, Larry Livermore, owner of Lookout! Records, saw the band play an early show and signed the group to his label. In 1989, the band recorded its debut extended play, 1,000 Hours. Before 1,000 Hours was released, the group dropped the name Sweet Children; according to Livermore, this was done to avoid confusion with another local band Sweet Baby. The band adopted the name Green Day, due to their fondness for marijuana. Lookout! would release Green Day's debut studio album, 39/Smooth in early 1990. Green Day would record two extended plays later that year, Slappy and Sweet Children, the latter of which included older songs that the band had recorded for the Minneapolis independent record label Skene! Records. In 1991, Lookout! Records re-released 39/Smooth under the name 1,039/Smoothed Out Slappy Hours, and added the songs from the band's first two EPs, Slappy, and 1,000 Hours. In late 1990, shortly after the band's first nationwide tour, Sobrante left the East Bay area to attend college.The Lookouts drummer Tre Cool began filling in as a temporary replacement and later Cool's position as Green Day's drummer became permanent. The band went on tour for most of 1992 and 1993, and played a number of shows overseas in Europe. The band's second studio album Kerplunk sold 50,000 copies in the U.S. \n\nBreakthrough success (1994-1996):\n\nKerplunk's underground success led to a number of major record labels being interested in signing Green Day, and the band eventually left Lookout! and signed to Reprise Records after attracting the attention of producer Rob Cavallo. The group was impressed by his work with fellow Californian band The Muffs, and later remarked that Cavallo \"was the only person we could really talk to and connect with\". Reflecting on the period, Armstrong told Spin magazine in 1999, \"I couldn't go back to the punk scene, whether we were the biggest success in the world or the biggest failure ... The only thing I could do was get on my bike and go forward.\" After signing with Reprise, the band went to work on recording its major label debut, Dookie. Recorded in three weeks, and released in February 1994,Dookie became a commercial success, helped by extensive MTV airplay for the videos of the songs \"Longview\", \"Basket Case\", and \"When I Come Around\", all of which reached the number one position on the Modern Rock Tracks charts. That year, Green Day embarked on a nationwide tour with queercore band Pansy Division as its opening act. At a September 9, 1994 performance at Hatch Memorial Shell in Boston, mayhem broke-out during the band's set (cut short to seven songs) and by the end of the rampage, 100 people were injured and 45 arrested. The band also joined the lineups of both the Lollapalooza festival and Woodstock '94, where they started an infamous mud fight. During the concert, a security guard mistook bassist Mike Dirnt for a stage-invading fan and punched out some of his teeth. Viewed by millions by pay-per-view television, the Woodstock 1994 performance further aided Green Day's growing publicity and recognition, and helped push its album to eventual diamond status. In 1995, Dookie won the Grammy Award for Best Alternative Album and the band was nominated for nine MTV Video Music Awards including Video of the Year. In 1995, a new single for the Angus soundtrack was released, entitled \"J.A.R.\". The single debuted at number one on the Billboard Modern Rock Tracks chart. The song was followed by the band's fourth studio album, Insomniac, which was released in the fall of 1995. Insomniac was a much darker and heavier response to the band's newfound popularity, compared to the more melodic Dookie. The album opened to a warm critical reception, earning 4 out of 5 stars from Rolling Stone, which said \"In punk, the good stuff actually unfolds and gains meaning as you listen without sacrificing any of its electric, haywire immediacy. And Green Day are as good as this stuff gets.\" The singles released from Insomniac were \"Geek Stink Breath\", \"Stuck with Me\", \"Brain Stew/Jaded\", and \"Walking Contradiction\". Though the album did not approach the success of Dookie, it sold two million copies in the United States. In addition, the album won the band award nominations for Favorite Artist, Favorite Hard Rock Artist, and Favorite Alternative Artist at the 1996 American Music Awards, and the video for \"Walking Contradiction\" got the band a Grammy nomination for Best Video, Short Form, in addition to a Best Special Effects nomination at the MTV Video Music Awards. After that, the band abruptly cancelled a European tour, citing exhaustion. \n\nMiddle years and decline in commercial success (1997-2002):\nAfter a brief hiatus in 1996, Green Day began to work on a new album in 1997. From the outset, both the band and Cavallo agreed that the album had to be different from its previous albums. The result was Nimrod, an experimental deviation from the band's standard pop-punk brand of music. The new album was released in October 1997. It provided a variety of music, from pop-punk, surf rock, and ska, to an acoustic ballad. Nimrod entered the charts at number 10. The success of \"Good Riddance (Time of Your Life)\" won the band an MTV Video Award for Best Alternative Video. The song was also used in the second \"clip show\" episode of Seinfeld and on two episodes of ER. The other singles released from Nimrod were \"Nice Guys Finish Last\", \"Hitchin' a Ride\" and \"Redundant\". The band made a guest appearance in an episode of King of the Hill entitled \"The Man Who Shot Cane Skretteberg\", which aired in 1997. In late 1997 and most of 1998, Green Day embarked on a tour in support of Nimrod. In 2000, Green Day released its sixth studio album Warning. In support of the album, the band participated in the Warped Tour in 2000. The band also had an independent tour to support the album in 2001. Critics' reviews of the album were varied.Allmusic gave it 4.5/5 saying \"Warning may not be an innovative record per se, but it's tremendously satisfying.\"Rolling Stone was more critical, giving it 3/5, and saying \"Warning... invites the question: Who wants to listen to songs of faith, hope and social commentary from what used to be snot-core's biggest-selling band?\" Though it produced the hit \"Minority\" and a smaller hit with \"Warning\", some observers were coming to the conclusion that the band was losing relevance, and a decline in popularity followed. While all of Green Day's previous albums had reached a status of at least double platinum, Warning was only certified gold. At the 2001 California Music Awards, Green Day won all eight of the awards that it was nominated for. The group won the awards for Outstanding Album (Warning), Outstanding Punk Rock/Ska Album (Warning), Outstanding Group, Outstanding Male Vocalist, Outstanding Bassist, Outstanding Drummer, Outstanding Songwriter, and Outstanding Artist. The release of two compilation albums, International Superhits! and Shenanigans, followed Warning. International Superhits and its companion collection of music videos, International Supervideos!. Shenanigans contained some of the band's b-sides, including \"Espionage\", which was featured in the film Austin Powers: The Spy Who Shagged Me and was nominated for a Grammy Award for Best Rock Instrumental Performance. In the spring of 2002, Green Day co-headlined the Pop Disaster Tour with Blink-182 which was documented on the DVD Riding in Vans with Boys. \n\nAmerican Idiot and renewed success (2003-2006):\n\nIn the summer of 2003, the band went into a studio to write and record new material for a new album, tentatively titled Cigarettes and Valentines. After completing 20 tracks, the master recordings were stolen from the studio. Instead of re-recording the stolen tracks, the band decided to abandon the entire project and start over, considering the material to be unrepresentative of the band's best work. It was then revealed that a band called The Network was signed to Armstrong's record label Adeline Records with little fanfare and information. After the mysterious band released an album called Money Money 2020, it was rumored that The Network was a Green Day side project, due to the similarities in the bands' sounds. However, these rumors were never addressed by the band or Adeline Records, except for a statement on the Adeline website discussing an ongoing dispute between the two bands. Green Day collaborated with Iggy Pop on two tracks for his album Skull Ring in November 2003. On February 1, 2004 a new song, a cover of \"I Fought the Law\" made its debut on a commercial for iTunes during NFL Super Bowl XXXVIII. \n\nThe resulting album, American Idiot (2004), debuted at number one on the Billboard charts, the band's first album to reach number one, backed by the success of the album's first single, American Idiot. The album was labeled as a punk rock opera which follows the journey of the fictitious Jesus of Suburbia.American Idiot won the 2005 Grammy for Best Rock Album. The band also won a total of seven awards out of eight awards for which they were nominated, including the Viewer's Choice Award in MTV Video Music Awards 2005. Through 2005, the band toured in support of the album with nearly 150 dates (Longest tour in their career) visiting Japan, Australia, South America and the United Kingdom. While touring for American Idiot, they filmed and recorded the two concerts at the Milton Keynes National Bowl in England, which was voted 'The Best Show On Earth' in a Kerrang! Magazine Poll. These recordings were released as a live CD and DVD called Bullet in a Bible on November 15, 2005. This CD/DVD featured songs from American Idiot as well as songs from all its previous albums, except Kerplunk and 1,039/Smoothed Out Slappy Hours. The DVD featured behind-the-scenes footage of the band, and showed how the band prepared to put on the show. The final shows of its 2005 world tour were in Sydney and Melbourne in Australia, on December 14 and 17 respectively. On August 1, 2005, Green Day announced that it had rescinded the master rights to its pre-Dookie material from Lookout! Records, citing a continuing breach of contract regarding unpaid royalties, a complaint shared with other Lookout! bands. On January 10, 2006 the band was awarded with a People's Choice Award as favorite musical group or band. \n\n21st Century Breakdown and American Idiot: The Musical (2006-2010):\nGreen Day engaged in a number of other smaller projects in the time following the success of American Idiot. The group released an album under the name Foxboro Hot Tubs entitled Stop Drop and Roll!!!. In 2008, the Foxboro Hot Tubs went on a mini-tour to promote the record, hitting tiny Bay Area venues including the Stork Club in Oakland and Toot's Tavern in Crockett, CA. \n\nIn an interview with Carson Daly, Garbage lead singer Shirley Manson revealed that Butch Vig would be producing Green Day's forthcoming album. The span of nearly five years between American Idiot and 21st Century Breakdown was the longest gap between studio albums in Green Day's career. The band had been working on new material since January 2006. By October 2007, Armstrong had 45 songs written, but the band showed no further signs of progress until October 2008, when two videos showing the band recording in the studio with producer Butch Vig were posted on YouTube. The writing and recording process, spanning three years and four recording studios, was finally finished in April 2009. 21st Century Breakdown, was released on May 15, 2009. The album received a mainly positive reception from critics, getting an average rating between 3 and 4 stars. After the release, the album reached number one in fourteen countries, being certified gold or platinum in each. 21st Century Breakdown achieved Green Day's best chart performance to date. The band started playing shows in California in April and early May. It was their first live show in about three years. Green Day went on a world tour that started in North America in July 2009 and continuing around the world throughout the rest of 2009 and early 2010.Wal-Mart refused to carry the album as it contains a Parental Advisory sticker and requested that Green Day release a censored edition. The band members did not wish to change any lyrics on the album and responded by stating, \"There's nothing dirty about our record... They want artists to censor their records in order to be carried in there. We just said no. We've never done it before. You feel like you're in 1953 or something.\" In 2009, the band met with award-winning director Michael Mayer and many cast and crew members of the Tony Award-winning musical Spring Awakening to create a stage version of the album American Idiot.American Idiot: The Musical opened in the Berkeley Repertory Theatre during the end of 2009. The show features an expanded story of the original album, with new characters such as Will, Extraordinary Girl, and Favorite Son. On April 20, 2010, American Idiot: The Musical opened on Broadway, and Green Day released the soundtrack to the musical, featuring a new song by Green Day entitled \"When It's Time\". In June 2010 the iTunes received the single \"When It's Time\". During the Spike TV Video Game Awards 2009, it was announced that Green Day was set to have its own Rock Band video game titled as Green Day: Rock Band, as a follow-up to the last band specific Rock Band game, The Beatles: Rock Band. The game features the full albums of Dookie, American Idiot, and 21st Century Breakdown as well as select songs from the rest of Green Day's discography. During the second leg of the 21st Century Breakdown World Tour the band had said that they are writing new material. In an interview with Kerrang! magazine, Armstrong spoke about the possible new album: \"We did some demos in Berlin, some in Stockholm, some just outside of Glasgow and some in Amsterdam. We wanted get the songs down in some early form.\" The band also stated that they were recording a live album during the entire tour on the last date of the tour in Mountain View, California, also before playing the song \"Cigarettes and Valentines\". In October 2010, Dirnt was interviewed by Radio W, mentioning that they have completed the writing process of the ninth studio album. In the interview, Dirnt also mentioned that a new live album will \"most likely\" be released. The live CD/DVD and CD/Blu-ray entitled Awesome as Fuck was released on March 22, 2011. \n\n¬°Uno!, ¬°Dos!, and ¬°Tr√©! (2011-present):\nOn August 11, 2011, Green Day played a secret show in Costa Mesa, California, and performed an entire set of over 15 new songs allegedly for a possible upcoming album. Green Day put a news post on their official website which read \"Thanks everyone for coming out to the show...\" and \"Stay tuned for more\". It also included lyrics to a new song that was played at the show called \"Amy\" which is dedicated to Amy Winehouse, who died weeks before the show. In February 2012, Armstrong announced through Twitter that the band were in the studio, recording material for a new album. On February 24, 2012, the band began uploading behind the scenes videos of the recording of the new album to YouTube. On April 11, singer Billie Joe Armstrong announced that Green Day would be releasing a trilogy of albums called ¬°Uno!, ¬°Dos!, and ¬°Tr√©!. Armstrong stated that they would be released on September 25, 2012, November 13, 2012, and January 15, 2013 respectively. On June 14, 2012, Green Day released the official artwork of the album ¬°Uno! on YouTube and Facebook. Armstrong in a talk with Rolling Stone Magazine confirmed that each album will have a member of the band on its cover. The ¬°Uno! ¬°Dos! ¬°Tr√©! Ultimate Box Set has also been announced by Warner Bros. Records and will contain all three albums, as well as various other content, such as three digital singles and a one year online membership or renewal to the Idiot Club. The band played at the Rock En Seine festival in France on August 24-26, 2012, the Rock am See festival in Germany on September 1, 2012 and the Reading festival in the UK. The band has also announced a US tour supporting the trilogy, from November 2012 through February 2013. ¬°Uno! was released on September 24, 2012 and has been met with generally favorable reviews. \n\nMusical style and influences:\n\nGreen Day's sound is often compared to first wave punk bands such as the Ramones, The Clash, Sex Pistols, and the Buzzcocks. Citing the band's musical style prevalent on Dookie, Stephen Erlewine of Allmusic described Green Day as \"punk revivalists who recharged the energy of speedy, catchy three-chord punk-pop songs.\" While Armstrong is the primary songwriter, he looks to the other band members for organizational help. Billie Joe Armstrong has mentioned that some of his biggest influences are seminal alternative rock bands H√ºsker D√º and The Replacements, and that their influence is particularly noted in the band's chord changes in songs. Green Day has covered H√ºsker D√º's \"Don't Want to Know If You Are Lonely\" as a b-side to the \"Warning\" single, and the character \"Mr. Whirly\" in their song \"Misery\" is a reference to the Replacements song of the same name. Among other influences, Green Day have also cited The Who and power pop pioneers Cheap Trick. The band has generated controversy over whether the band's musical style and major-label status constitutes as \"true punk\". In reaction to both the style of music and the background of the band, John Lydon, former front man of the 1970s punk band the Sex Pistols commented: \n\"So there we are fending off all that and it pisses me off that years later a wank outfit like Green Day hop in and nick all that and attach it to themselves. They didn't earn their wings to do that and if they were true punk they wouldn't look anything like they do.\" \nArmstrong himself has discussed the group's status of being a punk band on a major record label, saying \"Sometimes I think we've become totally redundant because we're this big band now, we've made a lot of money - we're not punk rock any more. But then I think about it and just say, 'You can take us out of a punk rock environment, but you can't take the punk rock out of us.'\" English rock musician Noel Gallagher of Oasis also complained about the band semi-jokingly, claiming that they ripped off his song \"Wonderwall\" with their song \"Boulevard of Broken Dreams\". \n\nRelated projects:\nSince 1991, members of the band have branched out past Green Day and have started other projects with other musicians. Notable related projects of Green Day include Billie Joe Armstrong's Pinhead Gunpowder (which also features Green Day's live back-up guitarist Jason White), The Frustrators in which Mike Dirnt plays bass, and The Network, a collaboration between Green Day and members of the band, Devo in which all members play under fake stage names. Green Day has also released an album titled Stop Drop and Roll!!! on May 20, 2008, under the name Foxboro Hot Tubs, they currently use this name to book secret shows. In late December 2011, Armstrong formed a new side band called The Boo along his wife Adrienne and their two sons. In September 2006, Green Day collaborated with U2 and producer Rick Rubin to record a cover of the song \"The Saints Are Coming\", originally recorded by The Skids, with an accompanying video. The song was recorded to benefit Music Rising, an organization to help raise money for musicians' instruments lost during Hurricane Katrina, and to bring awareness on the eve of the one year anniversary of the disaster. In December 2006, Green Day and NRDC opened a web site in partnership to raise awareness on America's dependency on oil. Green Day released a cover of the John Lennon song \"Working Class Hero\", which was featured on the album Instant Karma: The Amnesty International Campaign to Save Darfur. The band performed the song on the season finale of American Idol. The song was nominated for a Grammy Award in 2008, though lost to The White Stripes' \"Icky Thump\". That summer, the band appeared in a cameo role in The Simpsons Movie, where they perform the show's theme song. Their version was released as a single on July 24, 2007. In 2009, the band collaborated with theatre director Michael Mayer to adapt their rock opera American Idiot into a one-act stage musical that premiered at the Berkeley Rep on September 15, 2009. The show then moved to Broadway on April 20, 2010. The reviews of American Idiot: The Musical have been positive to mixed. Charles Isherwood of The New York Times wrote an enthusiastic review for the Broadway production. He called the show \"a pulsating portrait of wasted youth that invokes all the standard genre conventions ... only to transcend them through the power of its music and the artistry of its execution, the show is as invigorating and ultimately as moving as anything I've seen on Broadway this season. Or maybe for a few seasons past.\" Jed Gottlieb of the Boston Herald enjoyed the premise of the show but found that \"the music and message suffer in a setting where the audience is politely, soberly seated\". Michael Kuchiwara of the Associated Press found the show to be \"visually striking and musically adventurous\", but noted that \"the show has the barest wisp of a story and minimal character development\". Paul Kolnik in USA Today enjoyed the contradiction that Green Day's \"massively popular, starkly disenchanted album ... would be the feel-good musical of the season\". Time magazine's Richard Zoglin opined that the score \"is as pure a specimen of contemporary punk rock as Broadway has yet encountered yet there's enough variety. ... Where the show fall short is as a fully developed narrative.\" He concluded that \"American Idiot, despite its earnest huffing and puffing, remains little more than an annotated rock concert. ... Still, it deserves at least two cheers - for its irresistible musical energy and for opening fresh vistas for that odd couple, rock and Broadway.\" Peter Travers from Rolling Stone, in his review of American Idiot, wrote \"Though American Idiot carries echoes of such rock musicals as Tommy, Hair, Rent and Spring Awakening, it cuts its own path to the heart. You won't know what hit you. American Idiot knows no limits--it's a global knockout.\" The musical has been nominated for a number of Tony Awards, including Best Musical and Best Scenic Design. It was also nominated for a number of Drama Desk Awards and Outer Critics Circle Awards. In October 2009, a Green Day art project was exhibited at StolenSpace Gallery in London. The exhibition showed artworks created for each of the songs on 21st Century Breakdown, was supported by the band, and led by their manager Pat Magnarella. He explained in an interview that \"Artists are basically like rock bands. Most are creating their art, but don't know how to promote it.\" For Billie Joe Armstrong, \"Many of the artists... show their work on the street, and we feel a strong connection to that type of creative expression.\" On April 13, 2011, a film version of American Idiot was confirmed. Michael Mayer, director of the Broadway musical, will be directing the film. It will be produced by Green Day, Pat Magnarella (Green Day's manager who also produced Bullet in a Bible, Awesome as Fuck, and Heart Like a Hand Grenade), Playtone (Tom Hanks and Gary Goetzman) and Tom Hulce. \n\nInvolvement in politics and social justice:\nWhen asked his opinion regarding whether all musicians ought to try to add a social or political message to their work, Armstrong replied that \" \nThe only people who should sing about social issues or politics are the ones who aren't full of shit. \n\" \n American Idiot was released two months before former President of the United States George W. Bush was reelected, and as a result the album became protest art. Created as an anti-war album, American Idiot contains many new-age protest songs, like Holiday which was against George Bush's decision to invade Iraq. Armstrong described the song as a means by which \"to battle your way out of your own ignorance\". \n\nBand members:\n\nCurrent members \nBillie Joe Armstrong - lead vocals, guitar, piano, harmonica (1987-present), \nMike Dirnt - bass, backing vocals (1988-present), rhythm guitar (1987-1988), \nTr√© Cool - drums, percussion, backing vocals (1990-present), \nSession and touring members \nJason White - lead and rhythm guitars, backing vocals (1999-present), \nJason Freese - keyboards, piano, saxophone, trombone, backing vocals (2003-present), \nJeff Matika - rhythm guitar, acoustic guitar, backing vocals (2009-present), \n\nFormer members \nJohn Kiffmeyer - drums, percussion (1987-1990), \nSean Hughes - bass (1987-1988), \nFormer touring members \nTimmy Chunks - guitars (1997-1999), \nGarth Schultz - trombone, trumpet (1997-1999), \nGabrial McNair - trombone, tenor saxophone (1999-2001), \nJeanne Geiger - trombone (2001), \nKurt Lohmiller - trumpet, timpani, percussion, backing vocals (1999-2004), \nMike Pelino - rhythm guitar, backing vocals (2004-2005), \nRonnie Blake - trumpet, timpani, percussion, backing vocals (2004-2005)",

                                "text": "Green Day is an American rock trio formed in 1987. The band has consisted of Billie Joe Armstrong (vocals, guitar), Mike Dirnt (bass guitar, vocals), and Tr√© Cool (drums, percussion) for the majority of its existence.  Green Day was originally part of the punk rock scene at 924 Gilman Street, Berkeley in  East Bay, CA, United States . Its early releases for independent record label Lookout! Records earned them a grassroots fanbase, some of whom felt alienated when the band signed to a major label. Nevertheless, its major label debut Dookie (1994) became a breakout success and eventually sold over 10 million copies in the US. and 15 million worldwide. As a result, Green Day was widely credited, alongside fellow California punk bands The Offspring and Rancid, with reviving mainstream interest in and popularizing punk rock in the United States. Green Day's three follow-up albums, Insomniac, Nimrod and Warning did not achieve the massive success of Dookie, but they were still successful, reaching double platinum, double platinum, and gold status respectively. Green Day's 2004 rock opera American Idiot reignited the band's popularity with a younger generation, selling five million copies in the U.S.The band's eighth studio album, 21st Century Breakdown, was released on May 15, 2009.  Green Day has sold over 22 million records in the United States.They have won three Grammy Awards; Best Alternative Album for Dookie, Best Rock Album for American Idiot, and Record of the Year for Boulevard of Broken Dreams.  In 1987, friends Billie Joe Armstrong and Mike Dirnt, 15 years old at the time, formed a band called Sweet Children. The first Sweet Children show took place on October 17, 1987, at Rod's Hickory Pit in Vallejo, California where Armstrong's mother was working.In 1988, Armstrong and Dirnt began working with former Isocracy drummer, John Kiffmeyer (also known as Al Sobrante). Kiffmeyer served as both the band's drummer and business manager, handling the booking of shows and helping the band establish a fan base.  Larry Livermore, owner of Lookout! Records, saw the band play an early show and signed them to his label. In 1989 they recorded their first EP, 1,000 Hours. Before 1,000 Hours was released, the band dropped the name Sweet Children, according to Livermore this was done in order to avoid confusion with another local band Sweet Baby.The band adopted the name Green Day, allegedly due to their fondness of marijuana.  Lookout! would release Green Day's first LP, 39/Smooth in early 1990. Green Day would record two EPs later that year: Slappy and Sweet Children, the latter of which included some older songs they had recorded for Minneapolis indie label Skene! Records. In 1991, Lookout! Records released 1,039/Smoothed Out Slappy Hours, a compilation of the 39/Smooth, Slappy, and 1,000 Hours EPs. In late 1990, shortly after the band's first nationwide tour, Sobrante left the East Bay area to attend college. The Lookouts drummer Tr√© Cool began filling in as a temporary replacement, and when it became clear that Sobrante did not plan on committing to the band full time, Tr√© Cool's position as Green Day's drummer became permanent. The band went on tour for most of 1992 and 1993, and played a stretch of shows overseas in Europe. The band's second full length album Kerplunk sold about 50,000 copies in the U.S., which was considered quite a large amount for the independent punk scene in 1992.  Kerplunk's underground success led to a wave of interest coming from major record labels, and eventually they left Lookout! on friendly terms and signed with Reprise Records after attracting the attention of producer Rob Cavallo. Signing to Reprise caused many punk rock fans to regard Green Day as sellouts.Reflecting on the period, Armstrong told SPIN magazine in 1999, \"I couldn't go back to the punk scene, whether we were the biggest success in the world or the biggest failure ... The only thing I could do was get on my bike and go forward.\" After signing with Reprise, the band went to work on recording its major label debut, Dookie.  \"Longview\" Play sound Sample of \"Longview\", the first single from Dookie, which combined a memorable bass line with a guitar riff and drums introduced in the chorus. Problems listening to this file? See media help.  \"Basket Case\" Play sound Sample of \"Basket Case\", the third single from Dookie, which was about Armstrong's panic attacks. Problems listening to this file? See media help.  Released in February 1994, and recorded in 3 weeks,Dookie became a commercial success, helped by extensive MTV airplay for the videos of the songs \"Longview\", \"Basket Case\", and \"When I Come Around\", all of which reached the number one position on the Modern Rock Tracks charts. That year, Green Day embarked on a nationwide tour with queercore band Pansy Division as its opening act. At a September 9, 1994 concert at Boston Esplanade, mayhem broke-out during the band's set (cut short to seven songs) and by the end of the rampage, 100 people were injured and 45 arrested. The band also joined the lineups of both the Lollapalooza festival and Woodstock 1994, where they started an infamous mud fight. During the concert, a security guard mistook bassist Mike Dirnt for a stage-invading fan and punched out some of his teeth. Viewed by millions via pay-per-view television, the Woodstock 1994 performance further aided Green Day's growing publicity and recognition, and helped push its album to eventual diamond status. In 1995, Dookie won the Grammy Award for Best Alternative Album and the band was nominated for 9 MTV Video Music Awards including Video of the Year. The full fold-out artwork to Insomniac, entitled God Told Me to Skin You Alive.  In 1995, a new single for the Angus soundtrack was released, titled \"J.A.R.\". The single went straight to number one on the Billboard Modern Rock Tracks chart. The song was followed by the band's new album, Insomniac, which was released in the fall of 1995. Insomniac was a much darker and heavier response by the band, compared to the poppier, more melodic Dookie. Insomniac opened to a warm critical reception, earning 4 out of 5 stars from Rolling Stone, which said \"In punk, the good stuff actually unfolds and gains meaning as you listen without sacrificing any of its electric, haywire immediacy. And Green Day are as good as this stuff gets.\"Insomniac used a piece of art by Winston Smith entitled God Told Me to Skin You Alive for its album cover. The singles released from Insomniac were \"Geek Stink Breath\", \"Brain Stew/Jaded\", \"Walking Contradiction\", and \"Stuck With Me\". Though the album did not approach the success of Dookie, it still sold two million copies in the United States.Insomniac won the band award nominations for Favorite Artist, Favorite Hard Rock Artist, and Favorite Alternative Artist at the 1996 American Music Awards, and the video for \"Walking Contradiction\" got the band a Grammy nomination for Best Video, Short Form, in addition to a Best Special Effects nomination at the MTV Video Music Awards.[20] After that, the band abruptly cancelled a European tour, citing exhaustion.  Middle era: 1997-2002  After taking a break in 1996, Green Day began to work on a new album in 1997. From the outset, both the band and Cavallo agreed that the album had to be different from its previous records.The result was Nimrod, an experimental deviation from the band's standard pop-punk brand of music. The new album was released in October 1997. It provided a variety of music, from pop-punk, surf rock, and ska, to an acoustic ballad. Nimrod entered the charts at number 10. The success of \"Good Riddance (Time of Your Life)\" won the band an MTV Video Award for Best Alternative Video for the song's video, which depicted people undergoing major changes in their lives while Billie Joe Armstrong strummed his acoustic guitar. The song was also used in the second \"clip show\" episode of Seinfeld and on two episodes of ER. The other singles released from Nimrod were \"Nice Guys Finish Last\", \"Hitchin' a Ride\" and \"Redundant\". The band made a guest appearance in an episode of King of the Hill entitled \"The Man Who Shot Cane Skretteberg\", which aired in 1997.  In 2000, Green Day released Warning, a step further in the style that they had hinted at with Nimrod. Critics' reviews of the album were varied.Allmusic gave it 4.5/5 saying \"Warning may not be an innovative record per se, but it's tremendously satisfying.\" Rolling Stone was more critical, giving it 3/5, and saying \"Warning... invites the question: Who wants to listen to songs of faith, hope and social commentary from what used to be snot-core's biggest-selling band?\" Though it produced the hit \"Minority\" and a smaller hit with \"Warning\", some observers were coming to the conclusion that the band was losing relevance,and a decline in popularity followed. While all of Green Day's past albums had reached a status of at least double platinum, Warning was only certified gold.  At the 2001 California Music Awards, Green Day won all eight awards that they were nominated for. They won the awards for Outstanding Album (Warning), Outstanding Punk Rock/Ska Album (Warning), Outstanding Group, Outstanding Male Vocalist, Outstanding Bassist, Outstanding Drummer, Outstanding Songwriter and Outstanding Artist  The release of a Greatest Hits compilation, International Superhits!, and an assemblage of B-sides, Shenanigans, followed Warning. International Superhits and its companion collection of music videos, International Supervideos!, sold reasonably well, going platinum in the U.S. Shenanigans contained some of the band's b-sides, including \"Espionage\" which was featured in Austin Powers: The Spy Who Shagged Me and was nominated for a Grammy for Best Rock Instrumental Performance.  In the spring of 2002, Green Day co-headlined the Pop Disaster Tour with Blink-182. Despite the co-headlining title, Green Day would play each show before Blink-182, who at the time were experiencing more success. The tour was documented on the DVD Riding In Vans With Boys.  American Idiot and renewed popularity: 2003-2006 Spectators watch Green Day from the grass slopes at the National Bowl.  In the summer of 2003 the band went into a studio to write and record new material for a new album, tentatively titled Cigarettes and Valentines. After completing 20 tracks, the master tapes were stolen from the studio. The band chose not to try to re-create the stolen album, but instead started over. By the end of 2003, Green Day collaborated with Iggy Pop on two tracks for his album Skull Ring. On February 1, 2004 a new song, a cover of \"I Fought the Law\" made its debut on a commercial for iTunes during NFL Super Bowl XXXVIII. The band underwent serious \"band therapy,\" engaging in several long talks to work out the members' differences after accusations from Dirnt and Cool that Armstrong was \"the band's Nazi\" and a show-off bent on taking the limelight from the other band members.  The resulting 2004 album, American Idiot, debuted at number one on the Billboard charts, the band's first ever album to top the chart, backed by the success of the album's first single, \"American Idiot.\" The album was billed as a \"punk rock opera\" which follows the journey of the fictitious \"Jesus of Suburbia\". American Idiot won the 2005 Grammy for \"Best Rock Album\" and the band swept the 2005 MTV music awards, winning a total of seven of the eight awards they were nominated for, including the coveted Viewer's Choice Award.  Through 2005, the band toured in support of the album with about 150 dates -- the longest tour in its career -- visiting Japan, Australia, South America and the United Kingdom, where they drew a crowd of 130,000 people over a span of two days. While touring for American Idiot, they filmed and recorded the two concerts at the Milton Keynes National Bowl in England, which was voted 'The Best Show On Earth' in a Kerrang! Magazine Poll.  These recordings were released as a live CD and DVD called Bullet in a Bible on November 15, 2005. This CD/DVD featured hits from American Idiot as well as a few songs from all its previous albums, except \"Kerplunk\" and \"1,039/Smoothed Out Slappy Hours\". The DVD featured behind-the-scenes footage of the band, and showed how the band prepared to put on the show. The final shows of its 2005 world tour were in Sydney, Australia, and Melbourne, Australia, on December 14 and 17 respectively. On January 10, 2006 the band was awarded with a People's Choice Award for favorite group. Green Day live in Germany during the American Idiot tour.  On August 1, 2005, Green Day announced that that it had rescinded the master rights to its pre-Dookie material from Lookout! Records, citing a continuing breach of contract regarding unpaid royalties, a complaint shared with other Lookout! bands. The pre-Dookie material, which remained out of print for about a year, was reissued by the band's current label, Reprise, on January 9, 2007.  In 2006, Green Day won the Grammy Award for Record of the Year for \"Boulevard of Broken Dreams\" which spent 16 weeks at the number one position of Billboard's Modern Rock Tracks, a record it shared along with Red Hot Chili Peppers' \"Scar Tissue\" and Staind's \"It's Been Awhile,\" (the record has been since been beaten by Foo Fighters' 2007 hit \"The Pretender\" which reigned at the top spot for 18 weeks).  Foxboro Hot Tubs and 21st Century Breakdown: 2007 onward  Green Day engaged in several other smaller projects in the time following the hype of American Idiot. In the spring of 2007, Green Day recorded a cover of the John Lennon song \"Working Class Hero\", which appeared on a compilation album \"Instant Karma\", that benefitted victims in Darfur. In the summer of 2007, Green Day recorded a version of The Simpsons theme song for The Simpsons Movie, as well as having an appearance in the movie.  Green Day recently released a new album under the name Foxboro Hot Tubs entitled Stop Drop and Roll!!!. In an interview with Kerrang!, Billie Joe revealed that 2008 would \"be a fair estimate of the release date of their new untitled eighth studio album.\"In a recent interview with Carson Daly, Garbage lead singer Shirley Manson revealed that Butch Vig would be producing Green Day's forthcoming album. In October 2008 Green Day returned to the studios with Butch Vig, to start recording the new studio album. Two videos showing the band in the studio were posted on YouTube. In the tour section of the band's official website, the message \"World Tour coming soon!\" is shown.In the December 9 issue of Alternative Press, in-depth details about the new album were released. According to the interview, Green Day are recording in the same studio as they did for American Idiot, Ocean Way Recording in Hollywood, California. \"This album is more... religious\", and is influenced by Bob Dylan, Bruce Springsteen, and The Beatles, to name a few.Billie Joe Armstrong said when he was being interviewed for Kerrang!'s readers poll, that it will be more power pop than punk rock.The new album is titled 21st Century Breakdown and was released worldwide on May 15, 2009. Green Day will be going on a world tour starting with North America in July, 2009 until sometime in 2010. Singles from 21st Century Breakdown include Know Your Enemy and 21 Guns.  Musical style and influences  Green Day's sound is often compared to first wave punk bands such as the Ramones, The Clash, Sex Pistols, The Jam, and the Buzzcocks. The majority of their song catalog is composed of distorted guitar, fast, manic drums, and relatively high-treble bass. Most of their songs are fast-paced and under four minutes. Billie Joe Armstrong has mentioned that some of his biggest influences are seminal alternative rock bands H√ºsker D√º and The Replacements, and that their influence is particularly noted in the band's chord changes in songs. In fact, Green Day has covered H√ºsker D√º's \"Don't Want to Know If You Are Lonely\" as a b-side for the \"Warning\" single, and the character \"Mr. Whirly\" in their song \"Misery\" is a reference to the Replacements song of the same name. Among other influences, Green Day have also cited Queen,proto-punks The Who, and power pop pioneers Cheap Trick [46]. Armstrong's lyrics commonly describe alienation, (\"Jesus of Suburbia\", \"Boulevard of Broken Dreams\", \"Road to Acceptance\", \"Disappearing Boy\", \"Castaway\") hysteria (\"Basket Case\", \"Panic Song\"), girls (\"She\", \"80\" \"Only of You\",\"Maria\" \"She's a Rebel\"), growing up (\"Longview\" and \"Welcome to Paradise\"), and the effects of doing drugs (\"Geek Stink Breath\", \"Green Day\"). The Ramones had similar lyrical themes such as hysteria (\"Anxiety\", \"Psycho Therapy\"), alienation (\"Outsider\", \"Something To Believe In\"), girls (\"I Wanna Be Your Boyfriend\", \"Sheena Is a Punk Rocker\"), and drugs (\"Now I Wanna Sniff Some Glue\", \"Chinese Rocks\"). Green Day has covered Ramones songs several times, including recording \"Outsider\" for the tribute album We're a Happy Family, and performing \"Blitzkrieg Bop\" and \"Teenage Lobotomy\" when the Ramones were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2002.  Criticism and controversy  Beginning with the release of Dookie, and the subsequent explosion of MTV airplay it received, Green Day has received considerable criticism from those who see the punk genre as a social movement independent of corporate sponsorship. With the release of American Idiot and the subsequent draw of many new fans, much of this criticism has been revived.  One of the more contentious issues is genre labeling. In reaction to both the style of music and the background of the band, many fans and musicians have taken heavy objection to the usage of the term \"punk\" when applied to Green Day. This is evidenced by the following comments issued by John Lydon (Johnny Rotten), former front man of both the 1970s punk band the Sex Pistols and the 1980s post-punk, Public Image Ltd.: \" So there we are fending off all that and it pisses me off that years later a wank outfit like Green Day hop in and nick all that and attach it to themselves. They didn't earn their wings to do that and if they were true punk they wouldn't look anything like they do. \"  Brandon Flowers of The Killers went on record in 2007 claiming that Green Day's politically driven concept album American Idiot displays \"calculated Anti-Americanism.\" He explained that he has problems with the album content itself and also the fact that the band's recent live DVD, Bullet in a Bible, was filmed in England. The taping of the concert, featured on Bullet in a Bible, shows thousands of Europeans singing along to \"American Idiot.\" Stating that he felt Green Day's DVD is a bit of a stunt, he said, \"I just thought it was really cheap. To go to a place like England or Germany and sing that song - those kids aren't taking it the same way that he meant it. And he (Billie Joe Armstrong) knew it.\"  More recently, Oasis guitarist Noel Gallagher has accused the band of ripping off his song \"Wonderwall\" for \"Boulevard of Broken Dreams\".  Related projects Main article: Green Day related projects  Ever since 1991, some members of the band have branched out past Green Day and have started other projects with other musicians. Notable related projects of Green Day include Billie Joe Armstrong's Pinhead Gunpowder (which also features Green Day's live backup guitarist Jason White), The Frustrators in which Mike Dirnt plays bass, and The Network, in which all three members of Green Day play under fake stage names. Billie Joe Armstrong has also confirmed that the main members of Green Day are in the band Foxboro Hot Tubs. A Foxboro Hot Tubs album titled Stop Drop and Roll!!! was released on 2008-05-20.  Charity projects that the band have been involved with include the collaboration with U2 (\"The Saints Are Coming\") to help raise money for musical instruments lost in Hurricane Katrina, and teaming with the Natural Resources Defense Council for the \"Move America Beyond Oil\" campaign and other environmental concerns.  In September 2006, Green Day teamed up with U2 and producer Rick Rubin to record a cover of the song \"The Saints Are Coming\", originally recorded by The Skids, with an accompanying video. The song is to benefit Music Rising, an organization to help raise money for musicians' instruments lost during Hurricane Katrina, and to bring awareness on the eve of the one year anniversary of the disaster.  \"Working Class Hero\" Play sound \"Working Class Hero\", a cover of a John Lennon song, was released on the Instant Karma CD. Problems listening to this file? See media help.  In December 2006, Green Day and NRDC opened a web site in partnership to raise awareness on America's dependency on oil. (See related projects.)  Green Day released a cover of the John Lennon song \"Working Class Hero\", that was featured on the album Instant Karma: The Amnesty International Campaign to Save Darfur. The band performed the song on the season finale of American Idol. The song was nominated for a Grammy in 2008, but lost to The White Stripes' \"Icky Thump\".  That summer, the band appeared in a cameo role in The Simpsons Movie, where they perform the show's theme song. Their version was released as a single on July 24, 2007.

                                "text": "Sonny John Moore (born January 15, 1988), better known by his stage name Skrillex, is an American electronic music producer and singer-songwriter. Raised in Northeast Los Angeles and in Northern California, Moore joined the American post-hardcore band From First to Last as the lead singer in 2004, and recorded two studio albums with the band (Dear Diary, My Teen Angst Has a Body Count, 2004, and Heroine, 2006) before leaving to pursue a solo career in 2007. He began his first tour as a solo artist in late 2007. After recruiting a new band lineup, Moore joined the Alternative Press Tour to support bands such as All Time Low and The Rocket Summer, and appeared on the cover of Alternative Press' annual \"100 Bands You Need to Know\" issue. After releasing the Gypsyhook EP in 2009, Moore was scheduled to record his debut studio album, Bells, with producer Noah Shain. However, he ceased production of the album and began performing under the name Skrillex. After releasing the My Name is Skrillex EP for free download on his official MySpace page, he released the Scary Monsters and Nice Sprites EP in late-2010 and More Monsters and Sprites EP in mid-2011. Both have since become moderate commercial successes. On November 30, 2011, he was nominated for a total of five Grammy Awards at the 54th Grammy Awards, including Best New Artist and won three: \"Best Dance/Electronica Album,\" \"Best Dance Recording,\" and \"Best Remixed Recording, Non-Classical\". On December 5, 2011, the BBC announced that he had been nominated for their Sound of 2012 poll. On December 12, 2011, he was also named MTV's Electronic Dance Music Artist of the Year. \n\nBiography:\n\nBackground:\nMoore was born in the Highland Park neighborhood of Northeast Los Angeles, but moved to the Forest Hill neighborhood of San Francisco at the age of two, where he attended elementary school. At the ages of nine and ten, Moore attended a local boarding school located in the Mojave Desert LV, but eventually moved back to Northern California. By the age of twelve, his family moved him back to his birthplace of Northeast L.A., where he enrolled in a private academy school specializing in arts, and was then later home schooled at the age of fourteen due to bullying. In 2004, he learned he was adopted and dropped out of the program when he was sixteen years old. While a young teenager in Los Angeles, Moore would attend punk gigs in Mexican American neighborhoods in East and South Los Angeles, and later on electro club raves in the downtown's Silver Lake and Echo Park neighborhoods. \n\nFrom First to Last (2004-07):\nIn 2004, Moore contacted Matt Good of From First to Last about playing guitar for the band on their debut album. After flying out to Georgia, Moore was heard singing by three studio producers, Derrick Thomas, Eric Dale, and McHale Butler, and was then made lead singer, with Good playing guitar. In June 2004, Epitaph Records released the band's first full-length record with their new bandmate, Dear Diary, My Teen Angst Has a Body Count. After performing on several successful tours, two being the Vans Warped Tour and Dead by Dawn tour, they began recording their second album, Heroine with producer Ross Robinson. The album was released in March 2006 on Epitaph. With high record sales once again, the band found themselves part of many successful tours, until Moore started suffering vocal problems, causing the band to resign from several tours. After going through a successful vocal surgical procedure, Moore informed the band he would be permanently resigning to work on a solo career. FFTL's last show performed with Moore was in their hometown of Orlando at The House of Blues while touring with Atreyu. \n\nSolo career (2007-present):\n\nMoore announced he had left From First to Last to pursue a solo career. He then launched a Myspace page displaying three demos (\"Signal\", \"Equinox\", and \"Glow Worm\"). This led to Moore's first performance since his leaving From First to Last. On April 7, 2007, alongside harpist Carol Robbins, Moore played several original songs at a local art building. After months of releasing demos via Myspace, Moore played on the Team Sleep Tour with a full band. The tour also featured supporting acts Monster in the Machine and Strata. Moore made several demo CDs available on this tour, limited to about 30 per show. These CDs were tour exclusive, and were packaged in \"baby blue envelopes\", each with a unique drawing by Moore or bandmate. In February 2008, Alternative Press Magazine announced the second annual AP Tour, with All Time Low, The Rocket Summer, The Matches, and Forever the Sickest Kids, as well as Sonny Moore. The tour started in Houston, Texas on March 14 and went through North America, ending in Cleveland, Ohio on May 2, with the majority of the shows being sold out. All bands playing the tour would be featured on the cover of Alternative Press Magazine's annual 100 Bands You Need to Know special, and would be interviewed on the Alternative Press Podcast. During this tour Moore's line-up consisted of Sean Friday on drums, Christopher Null on guitar, and Aaron Rothe on keyboards. On April 7, 2009, he released Gypsyhook EP, a digital EP, which featured three songs and four remixes. Also included was a Japanese version of \"Mora\" entitled \"Êµ∑Ê∞¥\" (\"Kaisui\"). Physical copies of the EP were available at his shows. After going on tour with Innerpartysystem and Paper Route and opening for Chiodos on their European tour, Moore performed at Bamboozle on May 2. He performed on Bamboozle Left's Saints and Sinners stage on April 4. He toured with Hollywood Undead in April 2009 performing under the band name Sonny and the Blood Monkeys, with Chris Null (electric guitar), Sean Friday (drums, percussion & beats) and Aaron Rothe (keyboards, synthesizers, programming & turntables) Although no official statement has been given regarding the album, Moore has stated that Bells will no longer be released. \n\nProduction career:\n\nIn 2008, Moore began producing and performing under the alias Skrillex at clubs in the Los Angeles area. Previously, he had been known on the Internet as Twipz. On June 7, 2010, Moore released his official Skrillex debut EP, My Name is Skrillex as a free download. Moore provided programming and vocals for UK metalcore band Bring Me the Horizon on their third studio album, There Is a Hell, Believe Me I've Seen It. There Is a Heaven, Let's Keep It a Secret. Later in the year, Sonny began a nationwide tour with Deadmau5 after being signed to mau5trap recordings and released his second EP, Scary Monsters and Nice Sprites. Moore kicked off the \"Project Blue Book Tour\" in 2011 with support from Porter Robinson, Tommy Lee and DJ Aero as well as appearances from Sofia Toufa for a new song titled \"Bring out the Devil.\" Skrillex unveiled several new songs on this tour including \"First Of The Year\" (formerly known as \"Equinox\"), \"Reptile\", and \"Cinema\" (remix of a Benny Benassi track). \"Reptile\" was featured in the TV commercial for Mortal Kombat 9, and \"First of the Year (Equinox)\" is featured on his follow up EP and remix companion to Scary Monsters and Nice Sprites, titled More Monsters and Sprites. In April 2011, Spin magazine premiered \"Get Up\", an exclusive new track from Korn that was produced by Skrillex. Korn made \"Get Up\" available for free download via their Facebook page. On April 15, 2011 KoRn joined Skrillex on stage for his set at Coachella 2011. On April 18, 2011, Sony Computer Entertainment (SCEA) development studio Naughty Dog released a trailer for the multiplayer component of their PlayStation 3 game Uncharted 3: Drake's Deception, featuring \"Kill EVERYBODY\" from Scary Monsters and Nice Sprites. In June 2011, \"More Monsters and Sprites\" was released on Beatport, an EP consisting of three original tracks, including \"First of the Year (Equinox)\" and two versions of his original track \"Ruffneck\". A leaked track entitled \"Ruffneck Bass\" had been leaked on the internet months prior which used the same sample as in the new \"Ruffneck\" tracks on the EP. Skrillex released a music video for \"Rock n' Roll (Will Take You to the Mountain)\" on his official YouTube page on June 20, 2011. \n\nOn August 17, 2011 Skrillex announced his label, OWSLA. \"The label's first releases will come from Bristol-based dubstep producer Koan Sound, electro-house newcomer Porter Robinson from North Carolina, singer/songwriter Alvin Risk, and San Francisco-based M Machine (formally Metropolis).\" Skrillex released a music video for \"First of the Year (Equinox)\" via Spin.com on August 19, 2011. In late August 2011 it was released that he would be appearing Knife Party's first release, collaborating on a Moombahton style track entitled \"Zoology\". A preview was released on YouTube. In late September 2011 he created the track \"Syndicate\" as promotion for the video game of the same name. Kaskade's 2011 album Fire & Ice features a collaboration between Kaskade and Skrillex entitled \"Lick It\". The video for Skrillex's song \"First of the Year (Equinox)\" appears on the first episode of the Beavis and Butt-head revival. On November 8, Skrillex stated that he intended to release an album entitled Voltage. Skrillex gave fans more info about Voltage in RockSound Magazine after a photoshoot for the cover and doing an extensive interview on his tour. For unknown reasons, however, the album was never released. On December 21, 2011, Skrillex unveiled the Bangarang EP for a Beatport release on December 23. On March 13, 2012, Beatport released OWSLA's second Free Treats sampler, Free Treats Vol. 2. The 19-track compilation features \"Ruffneck (FULL Flex) Munchi Anonymous Revolution Remix\", a remixed track by Skrillex. This new take on the track deviates from the original (released on the More Monsters and Sprites EP), with the remix being more characteristic of Electro House, though with a much slower tempo of 108 BPM, versus the original version's classic Dubstep tempo of 140 BPM, also straying from the typical Electro House tempo of 128 BPM. On August 12, 2012, his new side-project formed with Boys Noize called Dog Blood released an EP called Next Order/Middle Finger. \n\nInfluences:\nMoore has stated in an online interview that he has been a longtime fan of Warp, an electronic music label that has released recordings from artists such as Aphex Twin and Squarepusher. \n\nPersonal life:\nAs of February 2012, Skrillex has been dating fellow artist and singer, Ellie Goulding, who provided vocals for the Skrillex track, \"Summit\", featured on the EP, Bangarang.",

                                "text": "Sonny John Moore (born January 15, 1988), better known by his stage name Skrillex, is an American electronic music producer and singer-songwriter. Raised in Northeast Los Angeles and in Northern California, Moore joined the American post-hardcore band From First to Last as the lead singer in 2004, and recorded two studio albums with the band (Dear Diary, My Teen Angst Has a Body Count, 2004, and Heroine, 2006) before leaving to pursue a solo career in 2007. He began his first tour as a solo artist in late 2007. After recruiting a new band lineup, Moore joined the Alternative Press Tour to support bands such as All Time Low and The Rocket Summer, and appeared on the cover of Alternative Press' annual \"100 Bands You Need to Know\" issue. After releasing the Gypsyhook EP in 2009, Moore was scheduled to record his debut studio album, Bells, with producer Noah Shain. However, he ceased production of the album and began performing under the name Skrillex. After releasing the My Name is Skrillex EP for free download on his official MySpace page, he released the Scary Monsters and Nice Sprites EP in late-2010 and More Monsters and Sprites EP in mid-2011. Both have since become moderate commercial successes. On November 30, 2011, he was nominated for a total of five Grammy Awards at the 54th Grammy Awards, including Best New Artist and won three: \"Best Dance/Electronica Album,\" \"Best Dance Recording,\" and \"Best Remixed Recording, Non-Classical\". On December 5, 2011, the BBC announced that he had been nominated for their Sound of 2012 poll. On December 12, 2011, he was also named MTV's Electronic Dance Music Artist of the Year. \n\nBiography:\n\nBackground:\nMoore was born in the Highland Park neighborhood of Northeast Los Angeles, but moved to the Forest Hill neighborhood of San Francisco at the age of two, where he attended elementary school. At the ages of nine and ten, Moore attended a local boarding school located in the Mojave Desert LV, but eventually moved back to Northern California. By the age of twelve, his family moved him back to his birthplace of Northeast L.A., where he enrolled in a private academy school specializing in arts, and was then later home schooled at the age of fourteen due to bullying. In 2004, he learned he was adopted and dropped out of the program when he was sixteen years old. While a young teenager in Los Angeles, Moore would attend punk gigs in Mexican American neighborhoods in East and South Los Angeles, and later on electro club raves in the downtown's Silver Lake and Echo Park neighborhoods. \n\nFrom First to Last (2004-07):\nIn 2004, Moore contacted Matt Good of From First to Last about playing guitar for the band on their debut album. After flying out to Georgia, Moore was heard singing by three studio producers, Derrick Thomas, Eric Dale, and McHale Butler, and was then made lead singer, with Good playing guitar. In June 2004, Epitaph Records released the band's first full-length record with their new bandmate, Dear Diary, My Teen Angst Has a Body Count. After performing on several successful tours, two being the Vans Warped Tour and Dead by Dawn tour, they began recording their second album, Heroine with producer Ross Robinson. The album was released in March 2006 on Epitaph. With high record sales once again, the band found themselves part of many successful tours, until Moore started suffering vocal problems, causing the band to resign from several tours. After going through a successful vocal surgical procedure, Moore informed the band he would be permanently resigning to work on a solo career. FFTL's last show performed with Moore was in their hometown of Orlando at The House of Blues while touring with Atreyu. \n\nSolo career (2007-present):\n\nMoore announced he had left From First to Last to pursue a solo career. He then launched a Myspace page displaying three demos (\"Signal\", \"Equinox\", and \"Glow Worm\"). This led to Moore's first performance since his leaving From First to Last. On April 7, 2007, alongside harpist Carol Robbins, Moore played several original songs at a local art building. After months of releasing demos via Myspace, Moore played on the Team Sleep Tour with a full band. The tour also featured supporting acts Monster in the Machine and Strata. Moore made several demo CDs available on this tour, limited to about 30 per show. These CDs were tour exclusive, and were packaged in \"baby blue envelopes\", each with a unique drawing by Moore or bandmate. In February 2008, Alternative Press Magazine announced the second annual AP Tour, with All Time Low, The Rocket Summer, The Matches, and Forever the Sickest Kids, as well as Sonny Moore. The tour started in Houston, Texas on March 14 and went through North America, ending in Cleveland, Ohio on May 2, with the majority of the shows being sold out. All bands playing the tour would be featured on the cover of Alternative Press Magazine's annual 100 Bands You Need to Know special, and would be interviewed on the Alternative Press Podcast.

Previously, he had been known on the Internet as Twipz. On June 7, 2010, Moore released his official Skrillex debut EP, My Name is Skrillex as a free download. Moore provided programming and vocals for UK metalcore band Bring Me the Horizon on their third studio album, There Is a Hell, Believe Me I've Seen It. There Is a Heaven, Let's Keep It a Secret. Later in the year, Sonny began a nationwide tour with Deadmau5 after being signed to mau5trap recordings and released his second EP, Scary Monsters and Nice Sprites. Moore kicked off the \"Project Blue Book Tour\" in 2011 with support from Porter Robinson, Tommy Lee and DJ Aero as well as appearances from Sofia Toufa for a new song titled \"Bring out the Devil.\" Skrillex unveiled several new songs on this tour including \"First Of The Year\" (formerly known as \"Equinox\"), \"Reptile\", and \"Cinema\" (remix of a Benny Benassi track). \"Reptile\" was featured in the TV commercial for Mortal Kombat 9, and \"First of the Year (Equinox)\" is featured on his follow up EP and remix companion to Scary Monsters and Nice Sprites, titled More Monsters and Sprites. In April 2011, Spin magazine premiered \"Get Up\", an exclusive new track from Korn that was produced by Skrillex. Korn made \"Get Up\" available for free download via their Facebook page. On April 15, 2011 KoRn joined Skrillex on stage for his set at Coachella 2011. On April 18, 2011, Sony Computer Entertainment (SCEA) development studio Naughty Dog released a trailer for the multiplayer component of their PlayStation 3 game Uncharted 3: Drake's Deception, featuring \"Kill EVERYBODY\" from Scary Monsters and Nice Sprites. In June 2011, \"More Monsters and Sprites\" was released on Beatport, an EP consisting of three original tracks, including \"First of the Year (Equinox)\" and two versions of his original track \"Ruffneck\". A leaked track entitled \"Ruffneck Bass\" had been leaked on the internet months prior which used the same sample as in the new \"Ruffneck\" tracks on the EP. Skrillex released a music video for \"Rock n' Roll (Will Take You to the Mountain)\" on his official YouTube page on June 20, 2011. \n\nOn August 17, 2011 Skrillex announced his label, OWSLA. \"The label's first releases will come from Bristol-based dubstep producer Koan Sound, electro-house newcomer Porter Robinson from North Carolina, singer/songwriter Alvin Risk, and San Francisco-based M Machine (formally Metropolis).\" Skrillex released a music video for \"First of the Year (Equinox)\" via Spin.com on August 19, 2011. In late August 2011 it was released that he would be appearing Knife Party's first release, collaborating on a Moombahton style track entitled \"Zoology\". A preview was released on YouTube. In late September 2011 he created the track \"Syndicate\" as promotion for the video game of the same name. Kaskade's 2011 album Fire & Ice features a collaboration between Kaskade and Skrillex entitled \"Lick It\". The video for Skrillex's song \"First of the Year (Equinox)\" appears on the first episode of the Beavis and Butt-head revival. On November 8, Skrillex stated that he intended to release an album entitled Voltage. Skrillex gave fans more info about Voltage in RockSound Magazine after a photoshoot for the cover and doing an extensive interview on his tour. For unknown reasons, however, the album was never released. On December 21, 2011, Skrillex unveiled the Bangarang EP for a Beatport release on December 23. On March 13, 2012, Beatport released OWSLA's second Free Treats sampler, Free Treats Vol. 2. The 19-track compilation features \"Ruffneck (FULL Flex) Munchi Anonymous Revolution Remix\", a remixed track by Skrillex. This new take on the track deviates from the original (released on the More Monsters and Sprites EP), with the remix being more characteristic of Electro House, though with a much slower tempo of 108 BPM, versus the original version's classic Dubstep tempo of 140 BPM, also straying from the typical Electro House tempo of 128 BPM. On August 12, 2012, his new side-project formed with Boys Noize called Dog Blood released an EP called Next Order/Middle Finger. \n\nInfluences:\nMoore has stated in an online interview that he has been a longtime fan of Warp, an electronic music label that has released recordings from artists such as Aphex Twin and Squarepusher. \n\nPersonal life:\nAs of February 2012, Skrillex has been dating fellow artist and singer, Ellie Goulding, who provided vocals for the Skrillex track, \"Summit\", featured on the EP, Bangarang.",

                                "text": "Sonny John Moore (born January 15, 1988), better known by his stage name Skrillex, is an American electronic music producer and singer-songwriter. Raised in Northeast Los Angeles and in Northern California, Moore joined the American post-hardcore band From First to Last as the lead singer in 2004, and recorded two studio albums with the band (Dear Diary, My Teen Angst Has a Body Count, 2004, and Heroine, 2006) before leaving to pursue a solo career in 2007. He began his first tour as a solo artist in late 2007. After recruiting a new band lineup, Moore joined the Alternative Press Tour to support bands such as All Time Low and The Rocket Summer, and appeared on the cover of Alternative Press' annual \"100 Bands You Need to Know\" issue. After releasing the Gypsyhook EP in 2009, Moore was scheduled to record his debut studio album, Bells, with producer Noah Shain. However, he ceased production of the album and began performing under the name Skrillex. After releasing the My Name is Skrillex EP for free download on his official MySpace page, he released the Scary Monsters and Nice Sprites EP in late-2010 and More Monsters and Sprites EP in mid-2011. Both have since become moderate commercial successes. On November 30, 2011, he was nominated for a total of five Grammy Awards at the 54th Grammy Awards, including Best New Artist and won three: \"Best Dance/Electronica Album,\" \"Best Dance Recording,\" and \"Best Remixed Recording, Non-Classical\". On December 5, 2011, the BBC announced that he had been nominated for their Sound of 2012 poll. On December 12, 2011, he was also named MTV's Electronic Dance Music Artist of the Year. \n\nBiography:\n\nBackground:\nMoore was born in the Highland Park neighborhood of Northeast Los Angeles, but moved to the Forest Hill neighborhood of San Francisco at the age of two, where he attended elementary school. At the ages of nine and ten, Moore attended a local boarding school located in the Mojave Desert LV, but eventually moved back to Northern California. By the age of twelve, his family moved him back to his birthplace of Northeast L.A., where he enrolled in a private academy school specializing in arts, and was then later home schooled at the age of fourteen due to bullying. In 2004, he learned he was adopted and dropped out of the program when he was sixteen years old. While a young teenager in Los Angeles, Moore would attend punk gigs in Mexican American neighborhoods in East and South Los Angeles, and later on electro club raves in the downtown's Silver Lake and Echo Park neighborhoods. \n\nFrom First to Last (2004-07):\nIn 2004, Moore contacted Matt Good of From First to Last about playing guitar for the band on their debut album. After flying out to Georgia, Moore was heard singing by three studio producers, Derrick Thomas, Eric Dale, and McHale Butler, and was then made lead singer, with Good playing guitar. In June 2004, Epitaph Records released the band's first full-length record with their new bandmate, Dear Diary, My Teen Angst Has a Body Count. After performing on several successful tours, two being the Vans Warped Tour and Dead by Dawn tour, they began recording their second album, Heroine with producer Ross Robinson. The album was released in March 2006 on Epitaph. With high record sales once again, the band found themselves part of many successful tours, until Moore started suffering vocal problems, causing the band to resign from several tours. After going through a successful vocal surgical procedure, Moore informed the band he would be permanently resigning to work on a solo career. FFTL's last show performed with Moore was in their hometown of Orlando at The House of Blues while touring with Atreyu. \n\nSolo career (2007-present):\n\nMoore announced he had left From First to Last to pursue a solo career. He then launched a Myspace page displaying three demos (\"Signal\", \"Equinox\", and \"Glow Worm\"). This led to Moore's first performance since his leaving From First to Last. On April 7, 2007, alongside harpist Carol Robbins, Moore played several original songs at a local art building. After months of releasing demos via Myspace, Moore played on the Team Sleep Tour with a full band. The tour also featured supporting acts Monster in the Machine and Strata. Moore made several demo CDs available on this tour, limited to about 30 per show. These CDs were tour exclusive, and were packaged in \"baby blue envelopes\", each with a unique drawing by Moore or bandmate. In February 2008, Alternative Press Magazine announced the second annual AP Tour, with All Time Low, The Rocket Summer, The Matches, and Forever the Sickest Kids, as well as Sonny Moore. The tour started in Houston, Texas on March 14 and went through North America, ending in Cleveland, Ohio on May 2, with the majority of the shows being sold out. All bands playing the tour would be featured on the cover of Alternative Press Magazine's annual 100 Bands You Need to Know special, and would be interviewed on the Alternative Press Podcast. During this tour Moore's line-up consisted of Sean Friday on drums, Christopher Null on guitar, and Aaron Rothe on keyboards. On April 7, 2009, he released Gypsyhook EP, a digital EP, which featured three songs and four remixes. Also included was a Japanese version of \"Mora\" entitled \"Êµ∑Ê∞¥\" (\"Kaisui\").

Previously, he had been known on the Internet as Twipz. On June 7, 2010, Moore released his official Skrillex debut EP, My Name is Skrillex as a free download. Moore provided programming and vocals for UK metalcore band Bring Me the Horizon on their third studio album, There Is a Hell, Believe Me I've Seen It. There Is a Heaven, Let's Keep It a Secret. Later in the year, Sonny began a nationwide tour with Deadmau5 after being signed to mau5trap recordings and released his second EP, Scary Monsters and Nice Sprites. Moore kicked off the \"Project Blue Book Tour\" in 2011 with support from Porter Robinson, Tommy Lee and DJ Aero as well as appearances from Sofia Toufa for a new song titled \"Bring out the Devil.\" Skrillex unveiled several new songs on this tour including \"First Of The Year\" (formerly known as \"Equinox\"), \"Reptile\", and \"Cinema\" (remix of a Benny Benassi track). \"Reptile\" was featured in the TV commercial for Mortal Kombat 9, and \"First of the Year (Equinox)\" is featured on his follow up EP and remix companion to Scary Monsters and Nice Sprites, titled More Monsters and Sprites. In April 2011, Spin magazine premiered \"Get Up\", an exclusive new track from Korn that was produced by Skrillex. Korn made \"Get Up\" available for free download via their Facebook page. On April 15, 2011 KoRn joined Skrillex on stage for his set at Coachella 2011. On April 18, 2011, Sony Computer Entertainment (SCEA) development studio Naughty Dog released a trailer for the multiplayer component of their PlayStation 3 game Uncharted 3: Drake's Deception, featuring \"Kill EVERYBODY\" from Scary Monsters and Nice Sprites. In June 2011, \"More Monsters and Sprites\" was released on Beatport, an EP consisting of three original tracks, including \"First of the Year (Equinox)\" and two versions of his original track \"Ruffneck\". A leaked track entitled \"Ruffneck Bass\" had been leaked on the internet months prior which used the same sample as in the new \"Ruffneck\" tracks on the EP. Skrillex released a music video for \"Rock n' Roll (Will Take You to the Mountain)\" on his official YouTube page on June 20, 2011. \n\nOn August 17, 2011 Skrillex announced his label, OWSLA. \"The label's first releases will come from Bristol-based dubstep producer Koan Sound, electro-house newcomer Porter Robinson from North Carolina, singer/songwriter Alvin Risk, and San Francisco-based M Machine (formally Metropolis).\" Skrillex released a music video for \"First of the Year (Equinox)\" via Spin.com on August 19, 2011. In late August 2011 it was released that he would be appearing Knife Party's first release, collaborating on a Moombahton style track entitled \"Zoology\". A preview was released on YouTube. In late September 2011 he created the track \"Syndicate\" as promotion for the video game of the same name. Kaskade's 2011 album Fire & Ice features a collaboration between Kaskade and Skrillex entitled \"Lick It\". The video for Skrillex's song \"First of the Year (Equinox)\" appears on the first episode of the Beavis and Butt-head revival. On November 8, Skrillex stated that he intended to release an album entitled Voltage. Skrillex gave fans more info about Voltage in RockSound Magazine after a photoshoot for the cover and doing an extensive interview on his tour. For unknown reasons, however, the album was never released. On December 21, 2011, Skrillex unveiled the Bangarang EP for a Beatport release on December 23. On March 13, 2012, Beatport released OWSLA's second Free Treats sampler, Free Treats Vol. 2. The 19-track compilation features \"Ruffneck (FULL Flex) Munchi Anonymous Revolution Remix\", a remixed track by Skrillex. This new take on the track deviates from the original (released on the More Monsters and Sprites EP), with the remix being more characteristic of Electro House, though with a much slower tempo of 108 BPM, versus the original version's classic Dubstep tempo of 140 BPM, also straying from the typical Electro House tempo of 128 BPM. On August 12, 2012, his new side-project formed with Boys Noize called Dog Blood released an EP called Next Order/Middle Finger. \n\nInfluences:\nMoore has stated in an online interview that he has been a longtime fan of Warp, an electronic music label that has released recordings from artists such as Aphex Twin and Squarepusher. \n\nPersonal life:\nAs of February 2012, Skrillex has been dating fellow artist and singer, Ellie Goulding, who provided vocals for the Skrillex track, \"Summit\", featured on the EP, Bangarang.",

                                "text": "Sonny John Moore (born January 15, 1988), better known by his stage name Skrillex, is an American electronic music producer and singer-songwriter. Raised in Northeast Los Angeles and in Northern California, Moore joined the American post-hardcore band From First to Last as the lead singer in 2004, and recorded two studio albums with the band (Dear Diary, My Teen Angst Has a Body Count, 2004, and Heroine, 2006) before leaving to pursue a solo career in 2007. He began his first tour as a solo artist in late 2007. After recruiting a new band lineup, Moore joined the Alternative Press Tour to support bands such as All Time Low and The Rocket Summer, and appeared on the cover of Alternative Press' annual \"100 Bands You Need to Know\" issue. After releasing the Gypsyhook EP in 2009, Moore was scheduled to record his debut studio album, Bells, with producer Noah Shain. However, he ceased production of the album and began performing under the name Skrillex. After releasing the My Name is Skrillex EP for free download on his official MySpace page, he released the Scary Monsters and Nice Sprites EP in late-2010 and More Monsters and Sprites EP in mid-2011. Both have since become moderate commercial successes. On November 30, 2011, he was nominated for a total of five Grammy Awards at the 54th Grammy Awards, including Best New Artist and won three: \"Best Dance/Electronica Album,\" \"Best Dance Recording,\" and \"Best Remixed Recording, Non-Classical\". On December 5, 2011, the BBC announced that he had been nominated for their Sound of 2012 poll. On December 12, 2011, he was also named MTV's Electronic Dance Music Artist of the Year. \n\nBiography:\n\nBackground:\nMoore was born in the Highland Park neighborhood of Northeast Los Angeles, but moved to the Forest Hill neighborhood of San Francisco at the age of two, where he attended elementary school. At the ages of nine and ten, Moore attended a local boarding school located in the Mojave Desert LV, but eventually moved back to Northern California. By the age of twelve, his family moved him back to his birthplace of Northeast L.A., where he enrolled in a private academy school specializing in arts, and was then later home schooled at the age of fourteen due to bullying. In 2004, he learned he was adopted and dropped out of the program when he was sixteen years old. While a young teenager in Los Angeles, Moore would attend punk gigs in Mexican American neighborhoods in East and South Los Angeles, and later on electro club raves in the downtown's Silver Lake and Echo Park neighborhoods. \n\nFrom First to Last (2004-07):\nIn 2004, Moore contacted Matt Good of From First to Last about playing guitar for the band on their debut album. After flying out to Georgia, Moore was heard singing by three studio producers, Derrick Thomas, Eric Dale, and McHale Butler, and was then made lead singer, with Good playing guitar. In June 2004, Epitaph Records released the band's first full-length record with their new bandmate, Dear Diary, My Teen Angst Has a Body Count. After performing on several successful tours, two being the Vans Warped Tour and Dead by Dawn tour, they began recording their second album, Heroine with producer Ross Robinson. The album was released in March 2006 on Epitaph. With high record sales once again, the band found themselves part of many successful tours, until Moore started suffering vocal problems, causing the band to resign from several tours. After going through a successful vocal surgical procedure, Moore informed the band he would be permanently resigning to work on a solo career. FFTL's last show performed with Moore was in their hometown of Orlando at The House of Blues while touring with Atreyu. \n\nSolo career (2007-present):\n\nMoore announced he had left From First to Last to pursue a solo career. He then launched a Myspace page displaying three demos (\"Signal\", \"Equinox\", and \"Glow Worm\"). This led to Moore's first performance since his leaving From First to Last. On April 7, 2007, alongside harpist Carol Robbins, Moore played several original songs at a local art building. After months of releasing demos via Myspace, Moore played on the Team Sleep Tour with a full band. The tour also featured supporting acts Monster in the Machine and Strata. Moore made several demo CDs available on this tour, limited to about 30 per show. These CDs were tour exclusive, and were packaged in \"baby blue envelopes\", each with a unique drawing by Moore or bandmate. In February 2008, Alternative Press Magazine announced the second annual AP Tour, with All Time Low, The Rocket Summer, The Matches, and Forever the Sickest Kids, as well as Sonny Moore. The tour started in Houston, Texas on March 14 and went through North America, ending in Cleveland, Ohio on May 2, with the majority of the shows being sold out. All bands playing the tour would be featured on the cover of Alternative Press Magazine's annual 100 Bands You Need to Know special, and would be interviewed on the Alternative Press Podcast. During this tour Moore's line-up consisted of Sean Friday on drums, Christopher Null on guitar, and Aaron Rothe on keyboards. On April 7, 2009, he released Gypsyhook EP, a digital EP, which featured three songs and four remixes. Also included was a Japanese version of \"Mora\" entitled \"Êµ∑Ê∞¥\" (\"Kaisui\"). Physical copies of the EP were available at his shows. After going on tour with Innerpartysystem and Paper Route and opening for Chiodos on their European tour, Moore performed at Bamboozle on May 2. He performed on Bamboozle Left's Saints and Sinners stage on April 4. He toured with Hollywood Undead in April 2009 performing under the band name Sonny and the Blood Monkeys, with Chris Null (electric guitar), Sean Friday (drums, percussion & beats) and Aaron Rothe (keyboards, synthesizers, programming & turntables) Although no official statement has been given regarding the album, Moore has stated that Bells will no longer be released. \n\nProduction career:\n\nIn 2008, Moore began producing and performing under the alias Skrillex at clubs in the Los Angeles area. Previously, he had been known on the Internet as Twipz. On June 7, 2010, Moore released his official Skrillex debut EP, My Name is Skrillex as a free download. Moore provided programming and vocals for UK metalcore band Bring Me the Horizon on their third studio album, There Is a Hell, Believe Me I've Seen It. There Is a Heaven, Let's Keep It a Secret. Later in the year, Sonny began a nationwide tour with Deadmau5 after being signed to mau5trap recordings and released his second EP, Scary Monsters and Nice Sprites. Moore kicked off the \"Project Blue Book Tour\" in 2011 with support from Porter Robinson, Tommy Lee and DJ Aero as well as appearances from Sofia Toufa for a new song titled \"Bring out the Devil.\" Skrillex unveiled several new songs on this tour including \"First Of The Year\" (formerly known as \"Equinox\"), \"Reptile\", and \"Cinema\" (remix of a Benny Benassi track). \"Reptile\" was featured in the TV commercial for Mortal Kombat 9, and \"First of the Year (Equinox)\" is featured on his follow up EP and remix companion to Scary Monsters and Nice Sprites, titled More Monsters and Sprites. In April 2011, Spin magazine premiered \"Get Up\", an exclusive new track from Korn that was produced by Skrillex. Korn made \"Get Up\" available for free download via their Facebook page. On April 15, 2011 KoRn joined Skrillex on stage for his set at Coachella 2011. On April 18, 2011, Sony Computer Entertainment (SCEA) development studio Naughty Dog released a trailer for the multiplayer component of their PlayStation 3 game Uncharted 3: Drake's Deception, featuring \"Kill EVERYBODY\" from Scary Monsters and Nice Sprites. In June 2011, \"More Monsters and Sprites\" was released on Beatport, an EP consisting of three original tracks, including \"First of the Year (Equinox)\" and two versions of his original track \"Ruffneck\". A leaked track entitled \"Ruffneck Bass\" had been leaked on the internet months prior which used the same sample as in the new \"Ruffneck\" tracks on the EP. Skrillex released a music video for \"Rock n' Roll (Will Take You to the Mountain)\" on his official YouTube page on June 20, 2011. \n\nOn August 17, 2011 Skrillex announced his label, OWSLA. \"The label's first releases will come from Bristol-based dubstep producer Koan Sound, electro-house newcomer Porter Robinson from North Carolina, singer/songwriter Alvin Risk, and San Francisco-based M Machine (formally Metropolis).\" Skrillex released a music video for \"First of the Year (Equinox)\" via Spin.com on August 19, 2011. In late August 2011 it was released that he would be appearing Knife Party's first release, collaborating on a Moombahton style track entitled \"Zoology\". A preview was released on YouTube. In late September 2011 he created the track \"Syndicate\" as promotion for the video game of the same name. Kaskade's 2011 album Fire & Ice features a collaboration between Kaskade and Skrillex entitled \"Lick It\". The video for Skrillex's song \"First of the Year (Equinox)\" appears on the first episode of the Beavis and Butt-head revival. On November 8, Skrillex stated that he intended to release an album entitled Voltage. Skrillex gave fans more info about Voltage in RockSound Magazine after a photoshoot for the cover and doing an extensive interview on his tour. For unknown reasons, however, the album was never released. On December 21, 2011, Skrillex unveiled the Bangarang EP for a Beatport release on December 23. On March 13, 2012, Beatport released OWSLA's second Free Treats sampler, Free Treats Vol. 2. The 19-track compilation features \"Ruffneck (FULL Flex) Munchi Anonymous Revolution Remix\", a remixed track by Skrillex. This new take on the track deviates from the original (released on the More Monsters and Sprites EP), with the remix being more characteristic of Electro House, though with a much slower tempo of 108 BPM, versus the original version's classic Dubstep tempo of 140 BPM, also straying from the typical Electro House tempo of 128 BPM. On August 12, 2012, his new side-project formed with Boys Noize called Dog Blood released an EP called Next Order/Middle Finger. \n\nInfluences:\nMoore has stated in an online interview that he has been a longtime fan of Warp, an electronic music label that has released recordings from artists such as Aphex Twin and Squarepusher. \n\nPersonal life:\nAs of February 2012, Skrillex has been dating fellow artist and singer, Ellie Goulding, who provided vocals for the Skrillex track, \"Summit\", featured on the EP, Bangarang.",

"text": "Skrillex is the pseudonym used by Los Angeles, California, USA musician Sonny Moore to differentiate his electronic solo work from his work with From First To Last and his other solo projects.   As Skrillex, Moore is an electronic DJ and producer boasting a musical style that incorporates electro house, fidget house, and dubstep.  Moore began producing and performing under the alias Skrillex at clubs in the Los Angeles area in 2008.    Throughout 2010, Skrillex became a bigger and bigger part of Moore's life.  On June 7, 2010 he released his debut EP as Skrillex, My Name Is Skrillex, as a free download.  Soon after, he was signed to mau5trap and began a nationwide tour with deadmau5.

"text": "Sonny John Moore (born January 15, 1988), better known by his stage name Skrillex, is an American electronic music producer and singer-songwriter. Raised in Northeast Los Angeles and in Northern California, Moore joined the American post-hardcore band From First to Last as the lead singer in 2004, and recorded two studio albums with the band (Dear Diary, My Teen Angst Has a Body Count, 2004, and Heroine, 2006) before leaving to pursue a solo career in 2007. He began his first tour as a solo artist in late 2007. After recruiting a new band lineup, Moore joined the Alternative Press Tour to support bands such as All Time Low and The Rocket Summer, and appeared on the cover of Alternative Press' annual \"100 Bands You Need to Know\" issue. After releasing the Gypsyhook EP in 2009, Moore was scheduled to record his debut studio album, Bells, with producer Noah Shain. However, he ceased production of the album and began performing under the name Skrillex. After releasing the My Name is Skrillex EP for free download on his official MySpace page, he released the Scary Monsters and Nice Sprites EP in late-2010 and More Monsters and Sprites EP in mid-2011. Both have since become moderate commercial successes. On November 30, 2011, he was nominated for a total of five Grammy Awards at the 54th Grammy Awards, including Best New Artist and won three: \"Best Dance/Electronica Album,\" \"Best Dance Recording,\" and \"Best Remixed Recording, Non-Classical\". On December 5, 2011, the BBC announced that he had been nominated for their Sound of 2012 poll. On December 12, 2011, he was also named MTV's Electronic Dance Music Artist of the Year. \n\nBiography:\n\nBackground:\nMoore was born in the Highland Park neighborhood of Northeast Los Angeles, but moved to the Forest Hill neighborhood of San Francisco at the age of two, where he attended elementary school. At the ages of nine and ten, Moore attended a local boarding school located in the Mojave Desert LV, but eventually moved back to Northern California. By the age of twelve, his family moved him back to his birthplace of Northeast L.A., where he enrolled in a private academy school specializing in arts, and was then later home schooled at the age of fourteen due to bullying. In 2004, he learned he was adopted and dropped out of the program when he was sixteen years old. While a young teenager in Los Angeles, Moore would attend punk gigs in Mexican American neighborhoods in East and South Los Angeles, and later on electro club raves in the downtown's Silver Lake and Echo Park neighborhoods. \n\nFrom First to Last (2004-07):\nIn 2004, Moore contacted Matt Good of From First to Last about playing guitar for the band on their debut album. After flying out to Georgia, Moore was heard singing by three studio producers, Derrick Thomas, Eric Dale, and McHale Butler, and was then made lead singer, with Good playing guitar. In June 2004, Epitaph Records released the band's first full-length record with their new bandmate, Dear Diary, My Teen Angst Has a Body Count. After performing on several successful tours, two being the Vans Warped Tour and Dead by Dawn tour, they began recording their second album, Heroine with producer Ross Robinson. The album was released in March 2006 on Epitaph. With high record sales once again, the band found themselves part of many successful tours, until Moore started suffering vocal problems, causing the band to resign from several tours. After going through a successful vocal surgical procedure, Moore informed the band he would be permanently resigning to work on a solo career. FFTL's last show performed with Moore was in their hometown of Orlando at The House of Blues while touring with Atreyu. \n\nSolo career (2007-present):\n\nMoore announced he had left From First to Last to pursue a solo career. He then launched a Myspace page displaying three demos (\"Signal\", \"Equinox\", and \"Glow Worm\"). This led to Moore's first performance since his leaving From First to Last. On April 7, 2007, alongside harpist Carol Robbins, Moore played several original songs at a local art building. After months of releasing demos via Myspace, Moore played on the Team Sleep Tour with a full band. The tour also featured supporting acts Monster in the Machine and Strata. Moore made several demo CDs available on this tour, limited to about 30 per show. These CDs were tour exclusive, and were packaged in \"baby blue envelopes\", each with a unique drawing by Moore or bandmate. In February 2008, Alternative Press Magazine announced the second annual AP Tour, with All Time Low, The Rocket Summer, The Matches, and Forever the Sickest Kids, as well as Sonny Moore. The tour started in Houston, Texas on March 14 and went through North America, ending in Cleveland, Ohio on May 2, with the majority of the shows being sold out. All bands playing the tour would be featured on the cover of Alternative Press Magazine's annual 100 Bands You Need to Know special, and would be interviewed on the Alternative Press Podcast. During this tour Moore's line-up consisted of Sean Friday on drums, Christopher Null on guitar, and Aaron Rothe on keyboards. On April 7, 2009, he released Gypsyhook EP, a digital EP, which featured three songs and four remixes. Also included was a Japanese version of \"Mora\" entitled \"Êµ∑Ê∞¥\" (\"Kaisui\").

"text": "Sonny John Moore (born January 15, 1988), better known by his stage name Skrillex, is an American electronic music producer and singer-songwriter. Raised in Northeast Los Angeles and in Northern California, Moore joined the American post-hardcore band From First to Last as the lead singer in 2004, and recorded two studio albums with the band (Dear Diary, My Teen Angst Has a Body Count, 2004, and Heroine, 2006) before leaving to pursue a solo career in 2007. He began his first tour as a solo artist in late 2007. After recruiting a new band lineup, Moore joined the Alternative Press Tour to support bands such as All Time Low and The Rocket Summer, and appeared on the cover of Alternative Press' annual \"100 Bands You Need to Know\" issue. After releasing the Gypsyhook EP in 2009, Moore was scheduled to record his debut studio album, Bells, with producer Noah Shain. However, he ceased production of the album and began performing under the name Skrillex. After releasing the My Name is Skrillex EP for free download on his official MySpace page, he released the Scary Monsters and Nice Sprites EP in late-2010 and More Monsters and Sprites EP in mid-2011. Both have since become moderate commercial successes. On November 30, 2011, he was nominated for a total of five Grammy Awards at the 54th Grammy Awards, including Best New Artist and won three: \"Best Dance/Electronica Album,\" \"Best Dance Recording,\" and \"Best Remixed Recording, Non-Classical\". On December 5, 2011, the BBC announced that he had been nominated for their Sound of 2012 poll. On December 12, 2011, he was also named MTV's Electronic Dance Music Artist of the Year. \n\nBiography:\n\nBackground:\nMoore was born in the Highland Park neighborhood of Northeast Los Angeles, but moved to the Forest Hill neighborhood of San Francisco at the age of two, where he attended elementary school. At the ages of nine and ten, Moore attended a local boarding school located in the Mojave Desert LV, but eventually moved back to Northern California. By the age of twelve, his family moved him back to his birthplace of Northeast L.A., where he enrolled in a private academy school specializing in arts, and was then later home schooled at the age of fourteen due to bullying. In 2004, he learned he was adopted and dropped out of the program when he was sixteen years old. While a young teenager in Los Angeles, Moore would attend punk gigs in Mexican American neighborhoods in East and South Los Angeles, and later on electro club raves in the downtown's Silver Lake and Echo Park neighborhoods. \n\nFrom First to Last (2004-07):\nIn 2004, Moore contacted Matt Good of From First to Last about playing guitar for the band on their debut album. After flying out to Georgia, Moore was heard singing by three studio producers, Derrick Thomas, Eric Dale, and McHale Butler, and was then made lead singer, with Good playing guitar. In June 2004, Epitaph Records released the band's first full-length record with their new bandmate, Dear Diary, My Teen Angst Has a Body Count. After performing on several successful tours, two being the Vans Warped Tour and Dead by Dawn tour, they began recording their second album, Heroine with producer Ross Robinson. The album was released in March 2006 on Epitaph. With high record sales once again, the band found themselves part of many successful tours, until Moore started suffering vocal problems, causing the band to resign from several tours. After going through a successful vocal surgical procedure, Moore informed the band he would be permanently resigning to work on a solo career. FFTL's last show performed with Moore was in their hometown of Orlando at The House of Blues while touring with Atreyu. \n\nSolo career (2007-present):\n\nMoore announced he had left From First to Last to pursue a solo career. He then launched a Myspace page displaying three demos (\"Signal\", \"Equinox\", and \"Glow Worm\"). This led to Moore's first performance since his leaving From First to Last. On April 7, 2007, alongside harpist Carol Robbins, Moore played several original songs at a local art building. After months of releasing demos via Myspace, Moore played on the Team Sleep Tour with a full band. The tour also featured supporting acts Monster in the Machine and Strata. Moore made several demo CDs available on this tour, limited to about 30 per show. These CDs were tour exclusive, and were packaged in \"baby blue envelopes\", each with a unique drawing by Moore or bandmate. In February 2008, Alternative Press Magazine announced the second annual AP Tour, with All Time Low, The Rocket Summer, The Matches, and Forever the Sickest Kids, as well as Sonny Moore. The tour started in Houston, Texas on March 14 and went through North America, ending in Cleveland, Ohio on May 2, with the majority of the shows being sold out. All bands playing the tour would be featured on the cover of Alternative Press Magazine's annual 100 Bands You Need to Know special, and would be interviewed on the Alternative Press Podcast. During this tour Moore's line-up consisted of Sean Friday on drums, Christopher Null on guitar, and Aaron Rothe on keyboards. On April 7, 2009, he released Gypsyhook EP, a digital EP, which featured three songs and four remixes. Also included was a Japanese version of \"Mora\" entitled \"Êµ∑Ê∞¥\" (\"Kaisui\"). Physical copies of the EP were available at his shows. After going on tour with Innerpartysystem and Paper Route and opening for Chiodos on their European tour, Moore performed at Bamboozle on May 2. He performed on Bamboozle Left's Saints and Sinners stage on April 4. He toured with Hollywood Undead in April 2009 performing under the band name Sonny and the Blood Monkeys, with Chris Null (electric guitar), Sean Friday (drums, percussion & beats) and Aaron Rothe (keyboards, synthesizers, programming & turntables) Although no official statement has been given regarding the album, Moore has stated that Bells will no longer be released. \n\nProduction career:\n\nIn 2008, Moore began producing and performing under the alias Skrillex at clubs in the Los Angeles area.

"text": "For the American southern gospel singer, songwriter and guitarist see Jacky Jack White  Jack White (born John Anthony Gillis on July 9, 1975 in Detroit), American rock musician, producer, and actor. He is best known as the guitarist and lead vocalist of the rock duo The White Stripes (1997-2011) and more recently guitarist and vocalist of The Raconteurs, and drummer and vocalist for the band The Dead Weather.  Jack White first played as a professional musician in the early 1990s, as a drummer for the Detroit cowpunk band Goober & the Peas. White produced Loretta Lynn's Van Lear Rose in 2004, which won them a Grammy for best country album, and an additional Grammy for best country collaboration for the song Portland Oregon.    The Love Interruption Songfacts reports that his debut solo single, Love Interruption, was made available on January 30, 2012 at White's pay-to-join club Vault and at Jackwhiteiii.com. A week later, it was released on the singer's preferred format, vinyl. It was produced by the ex White Stripe and recorded at his own Third Man Studio in Nashville along with its exclusive non-LP B-side Machine Gun Silhouette. This was followed by his first solo album, Blunderbuss, later in 2012, and an accompanying tour. This is not said to indicate an end to either the Raconteurs or the Dead Weather.  His blaring guitar solos and ability to pull sound from the simplest of \"instruments\" are his greatest strengths along with his desire to partner with female vocalists.  He currently resides in Tennessee. He announced his divorce in 2011 from wife since 2005, fellow musician Karen Elson, and they have two children. Third Man Records (White's label) and Elson's clothing boutique are also located there.  Last.fm Group: http://www.last.fm/group/Blunderbuss",

"text": "Jack White (n√© Gillis), often credited as Jack White III, is an American musician, singer, songwriter, record producer, multi-instrumentalist and occasional actor. He was best known as the vocalist, guitarist and pianist of The White Stripes until they split in February 2011, as well as a vocalist and guitarist for The Raconteurs and the drummer of The Dead Weather. White released his debut solo album, Blunderbuss, on April 24, 2012. He is ranked No. 70 on Rolling Stone's list of \"The 100 Greatest Guitarists of All Time\". White's popular and critical success with The White Stripes enabled him to collaborate as a solo artist with other renowned musicians, such as Beck, The Rolling Stones, Jeff Beck,Alicia Keys, Bob Dylan, Electric Six, Insane Clown Posse, and Loretta Lynn, whose 2004 album Van Lear Rose he produced and performed on. In 2006, White became a founding member of the rock band The Raconteurs. In 2009, he became a founding member and drummer of his third commercially successful group, The Dead Weather. He was awarded the title of \"Nashville Music City Ambassador\" by the Nashville mayor Karl Dean in 2011. \n\nEarly life:\nOf Polish, Scottish, and Canadian descent, John Anthony Gillis, the son of Teresa and Gorman Gillis, was born the youngest of ten children (six brothers, three sisters) in a lower middle-class neighborhood in Detroit, Michigan. He grew up in a Catholic family. His father and mother worked for the Archdiocese of Detroit, as the Building Maintenance Superintendent and secretary in the Cardinal's office, respectively. White eventually became an altar boy, which landed him an uncredited role in the 1987 movie The Rosary Murders, filmed mainly at Holy Redeemer parish in southwest Detroit. As a child he was a fan of classical music. He attended Cass Technical High School in Detroit. He began playing an instrument, a drum, at the age of six. As a teenager, White was already listening to the blues and 1960s rock that would influence him in The White Stripes,Son House and Blind Willie McTell being among his favorite blues musicians. He and his childhood friend, Dominic Suchyta (NKA Dominic Davis), would listen to records in White's attic on weekends and began to record cover songs on an old four-track reel to reel tape machine. At the time White was described as \"a kid with short hair and braces\". He has said in many interviews that Son House's \"Grinnin' In Your Face\" is his favorite song of all time. In 2005 on 60 Minutes, White told Mike Wallace that his life could have turned out differently. \"I'd got accepted to a seminary in Wisconsin, and I was gonna become a priest, but at the last second I thought, 'I'll just go to public school. I had just gotten a new amplifier in my bedroom, and I didn't think I was allowed to take it with me.\" At 15, White began a three-year upholstery apprenticeship with a family friend, Brian Muldoon. White credits Muldoon with exposing him to punk music and pushing him to play music with Muldoon as a band: \"He played drums, well I guess I'll play guitar then.\" The two recorded an album, Makers of High Grade Suites, as The Upholsterers. White later started a one-man business of his own, Third Man Upholstery. The slogan of his business was \"Your Furniture's Not Dead\" and the color scheme was yellow and black--including a yellow van, a yellow-and-black uniform, and a yellow clipboard. Although Third Man Upholstery never lacked business, White claims that it was unprofitable, because of his complacency about money and his business practices that were perceived as unprofessional, including making bills out in crayon and writing poetry inside the furniture. Shortly thereafter, White landed his first professional gig, as the drummer for the Detroit band Goober & the Peas. He also played in other local bands and did solo shows. \n\nRecording career:\n\nThe White Stripes:\n\nWhite formed The White Stripes in 1997, along with Meg White, The band began its career as part of the Michigan garage rock underground music scene, playing with local bands such as Bantam Rooster, The Dirtbombs, The Paybacks, Rocket 455, and The Henchmen, among others. In 1998, The White Stripes were signed to Italy Records, a small and independent Detroit-based garage punk label, by Dave Buick. The band released its self-titled debut album in 1999, and a year later the album was followed up by the cult classicDe Stijl. The album eventually peaked at No. 38 in Billboard's Independent Albums chart when the band had established their popularity. While performing and in music videos, Jack and Meg are very recognisable visually, as they dress only in red, white, and black. In 2001 the band released White Blood Cells. The album's stripped-down garage rock sound drew critical acclaim in the UK and soon afterward in the US, making The White Stripes one of the more acclaimed bands of 2002. The album was followed up in 2003 by the commercially and critically successfulElephant. Allmusic wrote that the album \"sounds even more pissed-off, paranoid and stunning than its predecessor ... darker and more difficult than White Blood Cells. \" The album's first single, \"Seven Nation Army\", was the band's most successful. The band's fifth album, Get Behind Me Satan, was recorded in White's own home and marked a change in the band's musical direction, with piano-driven melodies and experimentation with marimba and a more rhythm-based guitar playing by White. The band's sixth album Icky Thump, released in 2007, entered the UK Albums Chart at number one and debuted at number two on the Billboard 200. The album's sound also included more punk, garage and blues influences than its predecessor. In late 2007, the band announced the cancellation of 18 tour dates due to Meg White's acute anxiety problems. White had revealed plans to release a seventh, as of yet untitled album in the summer of 2009. However, this has yet to happen. The band also made their first live appearance since Meg's anxiety problems in September 2007 on the final episode of Late Night with Conan O'Brien on February 20, 2009. A documentary, The White Stripes: Under Great White Northern Lights, about the band's 2007 tour, in which they played a gig in every Canadian province and territory, appeared in the 2009 Toronto International Film Festival. In July 2007, The White Stripes made history by playing the shortest concert ever only playing one note, in St John's, Newfoundland. They played a full show later that night at the Mile One Centre in downtown St. John's. On February 2, 2011, it was reported on the main page of whitestripes.com that the duo has decided to part ways. White stated that it was not due to health issues or artistic differences but there were a \"myriad of reasons\". \n\nThe Raconteurs:\nWhite formed The Raconteurs in 2005 along with Brendan Benson, Jack Lawrence and Patrick Keeler. The origin of the band was the song 'Steady, As She Goes' which White wrote along with Benson. This inspired them to create a full band with the addition of Lawrence and Keeler. The band came together in Detroit during 2005 and, for the remainder of the year, recorded when time allowed. The band's debut album Broken Boy Soldiers was recorded at Benson's home in Detroit. The band set out on tour to support the album, including eight dates as the opening act for Bob Dylan. The group's second album, Consolers of the Lonely, and its first single, \"Salute Your Solution\", simultaneously in 2008. The album received a Grammy nomination. \n\nThe Dead Weather:\n\nIn early 2009, Jack White formed a new group called The Dead Weather with The Kills frontwoman Alison Mosshart. White takes drum and vocal duties, while The Raconteurs bassist Jack Lawrence and Queens of the Stone Age keyboardist and guitarist Dean Fertita round the four piece out. The group debuted a handful of new tracks on March 11, 2009 in Nashville from their debut album Horehound, which came out July 13, 2009 in Europe and July 14, 2009 in North America, on White's Third Man Records label. On October 16, 2009, Mosshart confirmed that the second album was \"halfway done\". The first single \"Die by the Drop\" was released on March 30, 2010. The new album, Sea of Cowards was released on May 7 in Ireland, then on May 11, 2010, in the U.S. and May 10 in the United Kingdom, and again, on White's Third Man Records. \n\nSolo career:\nIt was rumored that in 2003 White collaborated on Electric Six's song \"Danger! High Voltage.\" Both he and the Electric Six denied this, and the vocal work was credited officially to John S O'Leary. However, a recent radio interview with Tim Shaw on Kerrang! 105.2 in the UK had Electric Six lead singer Dick Valentine talking openly about White singing on this song as well as speculating on the amount of money he was paid ($60,000). Also, a Q magazine article stated that Jack White did in fact work with Electric Six on the song \"Gay Bar\". In 2008, White collaborated with Alicia Keys on the song \"Another Way to Die\", the theme song for the James Bond film Quantum of Solace. He performed five songs for the Cold Mountain soundtrack; \"Sittin' on Top of the World\", \"Wayfaring Stranger\", \"Never Far Away\", \"Christmas Time Soon Will Be Over\" and \"Great High Mountain\". In 2009, Jack White was featured in It Might Get Loud, a film in which he, Jimmy Page, and The Edge come together to discuss the electric guitar and each artist's different playing methods. White's first solo single, \"Fly Farm Blues,\" was written and recorded in 10 minutes during the filming of the movie, in August 2009. The single went on sale as a 7-inch vinyl record from Third Man Records and as a digital single available through iTunes on August 11. In November 2010, producer Danger Mouse announced that White has been recruited for his collaboration with Daniele Luppi entitled Rome along with Norah Jones. White provided vocals to three songs on the album: \"The Rose with the Broken Neck,\" \"Two Against One\" and \"The World.\" The song \"You Know That I Know\", finished and performed by White, was featured on The Lost Notebooks of Hank Williams, released on October 4, 2011. On January 30, 2012 White released \"Love Interruption\" as the first single of his debut solo album, Blunderbuss, which was released on April 24, 2012. On March 3, 2012, he appeared on Saturday Night Live as the musical guest, with Lindsay Lohan hosting. He'll be playing selected dates in the summer, with festivals such as Radio 1's Hackney Weekend, Sasquatch! Music Festival, Fuji Rock Festival in Japan, one of the biggest festivals in the world, Rock Werchter in Belgium, and later in the year, he'll be headlining Austin City Limits Music Festival. For his solo shows, White tours with two bands. One, The Peacocks, is all-female, and the other, The Buzzards (sometimes called Los Buzzardos), is all-male. \n\nMusical equipment and sound:\nThe guitars White uses live are two 1965 JB Hutto Montgomery Airlines (one which he received from a fan), a three pickup Airline Town & Country (used on tour with the Raconteurs and in the \"Steady As She Goes\" music video), a Harmony Rocket, a 1970s-era Crestwood Astral II, 1950s-era Kay Hollowbody (given to him by his brother in return for a favor), a Gretsch White Penguin (as seen in the music video for Icky Thump), and a custom Gretsch Rancher Falcon acoustic guitar. When playing with the Raconteurs, White usually plays two custom Gretsch-styled copies of the Duo Jet double-cutaway guitar, which were made in collaboration with his Seattle luthier, Randy Parsons. His main guitar is dubbed the Triple Jet, which is made of copper and features a Gretsch logo from 1912. For their first tour, Jack also played Gretsch Anniversary Jr. with a Bigsby vibrato tailpiece and three Filtertron pickups. He also uses a Gretsch Rancher acoustic guitar and he now uses a custom Gretsch Anniversary Jr. with two cutaways, a built-in retractable microphone, and a theremin next to the Bigsby. Jack has dubbed this one the \"Triple Green Machine\". Also, he plays occasionally with his Gretsch Rancher, a Gibson J-160E. Also, he plays a Gretsch Duo Jet in Cadillac Green. Recently, he has featured his latest Gretsch, a custom white Billy Gibbons/Bo Diddley signature Gretsch Jupiter Thunderbird in the music video for \"Another Way to Die\", this guitar is also used on his concerts with The Dead Weather, but he also uses a black left-handed one since Sea of Cowards came out. He has also been known to play Fender Telecasters, featuring one in the music video for Loretta Lynn's \"Portland, Oregon\". Jack White has also played in live shows, mainly with The Dead Weather, a Daddy Mojo Stove Pipe Cigar Box Guitar. White uses numerous effects to create his live sound, most notably a DigiTech Whammy WH-4 to create the rapid modulations in pitch he uses in his solos. In concert with an MXR Micro Amp and custom Electro-Harmonix Big Muff Distortion/Sustainer, White can produce a very distinctive sound. In 2005, for the single \"Blue Orchid,\" White employed a new Electro-Harmonix creation, the Polyphonic Octave Generator (POG). Similar to (but more versatile than) the Whammy IV, the POG lets the user mix in several octave effects into one along with the dry signal. He also has three Z.Vex Tremolo Probes, that are hand painted black. All of the pedals that he uses live have been professionally painted red to match his red/black/white color scheme (with the exception of his Whammy and the other pedals that are already red). He plugs this setup into a 1970s Fender Twin Reverb and two 100-Watt Sears Silvertone 6x10 combo amplifiers. He also has a Sonic Machine Factory 15 Watt amp in red that can be seen in Under Great White Northern Lights. He uses this as a travel amp for secret or small shows, and also as the amp for his various keyboards when playing for a larger audience. With the Raconteurs, he has many more unusual pedals. And also, for the Raconteurs' 2008 tour, he had all of his pedals copper plated by Analog Man. White also produces a \"fake\" bass tone by playing the Kay Hollowbody and JB Hutto Montgomery Airline guitars through a Whammy IV set to one octave down for a very thick, low, rumbling sound, which he uses most notably on the songs \"Seven Nation Army\" and \"The Hardest Button to Button\" during live performances. On occasion, White also plays other instruments, such as a Black Gibson F-4 mandolin (\"Little Ghost\"), piano (on most tracks from Get Behind Me Satan, and various others), and an electric piano on such tracks as \"The Air Near My Fingers\" and \"I'm Finding it Harder to be a Gentleman\". White also plays percussion instruments such as the marimba (as on \"The Nurse\"), drums and tambourine. For the White Stripes' 2007 tour, he played a custom-finish Hammond A-100 organ with a Leslie 3300 speaker, which was subsequently loaned to Bob Dylan, and currently resides at Third Man Studios. On Broken Boy Soldiers, he is credited as playing the album's synths and organ; however, bandmate Brendan Benson also received credit for these instruments and it is unclear who played on which song. With the Dead Weather, Jack plays a custom Ludwig Classic Maple kit in Black Oyster Pearl. The sizes consist of the following: 16x26 kick, 5x16 snare (primary) 12x14 marching snare (secondary), 7x16 rack tom 14x16 floor tom, two 16x16 floor toms, Paiste 2002 24\"crash, 24\"ride and two 16\" crashes as hi-hats. For the 2009 Full Flash Blank tour, Jack used a drum head with the Three Brides of Dracula on the front, but in 2010, Jack employs a new drum head, upon the release of Sea of Cowards, which has an image of The Third Man himself: Harry Lime attempting to escape certain capture in the sewers of Vienna. During the American leg of the 2010 tour, Jack switched his drum head again featuring a picture of himself in the guise he wore on the cover of Sea of Cowards. This drum head is called Sam Kay by some fans, referring to the insert inside of the 12\" LP. In 2010, Jack White added an acoustic guitar to his collection named Veronica Lake. It is a custom white Gretsch Rancher with a gold double pickguard and a picture of Veronica Lake on the back. He is currently playing it with his band The Dead Weather. It is the newest addition to \"Jack's Girlfriends\" which already include Claudette Colbert that he plays In the Raconteurs, and Rita Hayworth that he plays in the White Stripes. According to Joe Chiccarelli, engineer for Icky Thump, White is not very technical when it comes to capturing his sound on record: \"Usually he wouldn't talk in terms of compression or EQ or any of those things, it was always about what can we do to give something more aggression or hit you in the face more. Jack's brilliance is his understanding of great emotional performances, and of what it takes to make something come alive through the speakers and have an impact.\" \n\nPersonal life:\n\nWhite gives few interviews and reveals few details of his private life. He states that he does not consider it relevant to his art, saying \"It's the same thing as asking Michelangelo, 'What kind of shoes do you wear?'...In the end, it doesn't really matter ... the only thing that's going to be left is our records and photos.\" A topic of intrigue has been the actual relationship between Jack and Meg White. In early interviews, the pair presented themselves as siblings, two of ten. The Flaming Lips touch on this in their song \"Thank You Jack White (for the Fiber-Optic Jesus That You Gave Me)\" released on their 2003 EP Fight Test. However, the Detroit Free Press produced copies of both a marriage license and divorce certificate, confirming Jack and Meg's history as a married couple. Neither addresses the truth officially and over time, they have become less verbal about the origins of their relationship. Jack White has said, though, that siblings are \"mated for life\", thus such relationships distract less from the music. Jack mentions them being brother and sister in the documentary Under Great White Northern Lights. In the early 1990s, Meg White worked as a bartender at Memphis Smoke, a bar in downtown Royal Oak (a Detroit suburb), where she first met Jack, then still known under his original surname 'Gillis'. They were married on September 21, 1996 and were divorced on March 24, 2000. Jack took her last name. White is often referred to as eccentric. For instance, he has an obsession with the number three. On November 7, 2005, it was widely reported that White had changed his name to \"Three Quid\" (quid is British slang for pound sterling). However, most reports indicated that this would only last until the end of the tour. On December 13, 2003, White was involved in an altercation with Jason Stollsteimer, lead singer of The Von Bondies, at the Magic Stick, a Detroit club. White was charged with misdemeanor aggravated assault. He pleaded guilty to the lesser charge of assault and battery, and was fined $750 (including court costs), and was sentenced to take anger management classes. In 2003, White made his acting debut in Mutant Swinger from Mars, and had a brief but highly publicized romantic relationship with actress Ren√©e Zellweger, whom he met during the filming of Cold Mountain. That summer, the couple were in a car accident in which White broke his left index finger and was forced to reschedule much of the summer tour. He posted the footage of his finger surgery on the web for fans. White and Zellweger's breakup became public in December 2004. White met British model Karen Elson (twin sister of Kate Elson) when she appeared in The White Stripes music video for \"Blue Orchid\". The video's director, Floria Sigismondi, noted \"you sensed an energy between them\". They married on June 1, 2005 in Manaus, Brazil. The wedding took place in a canoe on the Amazon River and was officiated by a shaman. A Roman Catholic priest later convalidated their marriage. Manager Ian Montone was the best man and Meg White was the maid of honor. Official wedding announcements stated that \"it was the first marriage\" for both. On May 2, 2006, the couple had a daughter, Scarlett Teresa White. Their second child, Henry Lee White, was born on August 7, 2007. The White family resides in Brentwood, Tennessee, a suburb south of Nashville, where Elson managed a vintage clothing store called Venus & Mars. The couple announced their divorce in June 2011, throwing a divorce party to celebrate their sixth anniversary and the \"making and breaking of the sacred union of marriage,\" according to the invitation sent to guests. In a press statement, the couple vowed to remain \"dear and trusted friends and co-parents.\" It is rumored that Karen Elson is \"Mildred\" of the Third Man Records produced album, \"Mildred and The Mice\". In 2006, it was revealed in the Sunday Times Rich List that White and his British wife Elson had a joint fortune of at least ¬£20 million (US$37 million). This ranked them at seventh place in the list of entertainers under age 30 who were born or live in the United Kingdom, ahead of the likes of Orlando Bloom and Kate Winslet. \n\nTV appearances:\nOn January 9, 2012, Jack White appeared on American Pickers. In the episode Jack trades his photo booth, first Jukebox, and US$6,000 for a taxidermy elephant head. Jack White appeared as a guest of The Colbert Report in three consecutive episodes in 2011 (June 21-23), and again on April 26, 2012.",

"text": "For the American southern gospel singer, songwriter and guitarist see Jacky Jack White  Jack White (born John Anthony Gillis on July 9, 1975 in Detroit), American rock musician, producer, and actor. He is best known as the guitarist and lead vocalist of the rock duo The White Stripes (1997-2011) and more recently guitarist and vocalist of The Raconteurs, and drummer and vocalist for the band The Dead Weather.  Jack White first played as a professional musician in the early 1990s, as a drummer for the Detroit cowpunk band Goober & the Peas. White produced Loretta Lynn's Van Lear Rose in 2004, which won them a Grammy for best country album, and an additional Grammy for best country collaboration for the song Portland Oregon.    The Love Interruption Songfacts reports that his debut solo single, Love Interruption, was made available on January 30, 2012 at White's pay-to-join club Vault and at Jackwhiteiii.com. A week later, it was released on the singer's preferred format, vinyl. It was produced by the ex White Stripe and recorded at his own Third Man Studio in Nashville along with its exclusive non-LP B-side Machine Gun Silhouette. This was followed by his first solo album, Blunderbuss, later in 2012, and an accompanying tour. This is not said to indicate an end to either the Raconteurs or the Dead Weather.  His blaring guitar solos and ability to pull sound from the simplest of \"instruments\" are his greatest strengths along with his desire to partner with female vocalists.  He currently resides in Tennessee. He announced his divorce in 2011 from wife since 2005, fellow musician Karen Elson, and they have two children. Third Man Records (White's label) and Elson's clothing boutique are also located there.  Last.fm Group: http://www.last.fm/group/Blunderbuss",

"text": "Jack White (n√© Gillis), often credited as Jack White III, is an American musician, singer, songwriter, record producer, multi-instrumentalist and occasional actor. He was best known as the vocalist, guitarist and pianist of The White Stripes until they split in February 2011, as well as a vocalist and guitarist for The Raconteurs and the drummer of The Dead Weather. White released his debut solo album, Blunderbuss, on April 24, 2012. He is ranked No. 70 on Rolling Stone's list of \"The 100 Greatest Guitarists of All Time\". White's popular and critical success with The White Stripes enabled him to collaborate as a solo artist with other renowned musicians, such as Beck, The Rolling Stones, Jeff Beck,Alicia Keys, Bob Dylan, Electric Six, Insane Clown Posse, and Loretta Lynn, whose 2004 album Van Lear Rose he produced and performed on. In 2006, White became a founding member of the rock band The Raconteurs. In 2009, he became a founding member and drummer of his third commercially successful group, The Dead Weather. He was awarded the title of \"Nashville Music City Ambassador\" by the Nashville mayor Karl Dean in 2011. \n\nEarly life:\nOf Polish, Scottish, and Canadian descent, John Anthony Gillis, the son of Teresa and Gorman Gillis, was born the youngest of ten children (six brothers, three sisters) in a lower middle-class neighborhood in Detroit, Michigan. He grew up in a Catholic family. His father and mother worked for the Archdiocese of Detroit, as the Building Maintenance Superintendent and secretary in the Cardinal's office, respectively. White eventually became an altar boy, which landed him an uncredited role in the 1987 movie The Rosary Murders, filmed mainly at Holy Redeemer parish in southwest Detroit. As a child he was a fan of classical music. He attended Cass Technical High School in Detroit. He began playing an instrument, a drum, at the age of six. As a teenager, White was already listening to the blues and 1960s rock that would influence him in The White Stripes,Son House and Blind Willie McTell being among his favorite blues musicians. He and his childhood friend, Dominic Suchyta (NKA Dominic Davis), would listen to records in White's attic on weekends and began to record cover songs on an old four-track reel to reel tape machine. At the time White was described as \"a kid with short hair and braces\". He has said in many interviews that Son House's \"Grinnin' In Your Face\" is his favorite song of all time. In 2005 on 60 Minutes, White told Mike Wallace that his life could have turned out differently. \"I'd got accepted to a seminary in Wisconsin, and I was gonna become a priest, but at the last second I thought, 'I'll just go to public school. I had just gotten a new amplifier in my bedroom, and I didn't think I was allowed to take it with me.\" At 15, White began a three-year upholstery apprenticeship with a family friend, Brian Muldoon. White credits Muldoon with exposing him to punk music and pushing him to play music with Muldoon as a band: \"He played drums, well I guess I'll play guitar then.\" The two recorded an album, Makers of High Grade Suites, as The Upholsterers. White later started a one-man business of his own, Third Man Upholstery. The slogan of his business was \"Your Furniture's Not Dead\" and the color scheme was yellow and black--including a yellow van, a yellow-and-black uniform, and a yellow clipboard. Although Third Man Upholstery never lacked business, White claims that it was unprofitable, because of his complacency about money and his business practices that were perceived as unprofessional, including making bills out in crayon and writing poetry inside the furniture. Shortly thereafter, White landed his first professional gig, as the drummer for the Detroit band Goober & the Peas. He also played in other local bands and did solo shows. \n\nRecording career:\n\nThe White Stripes:\n\nWhite formed The White Stripes in 1997, along with Meg White, The band began its career as part of the Michigan garage rock underground music scene, playing with local bands such as Bantam Rooster, The Dirtbombs, The Paybacks, Rocket 455, and The Henchmen, among others. In 1998, The White Stripes were signed to Italy Records, a small and independent Detroit-based garage punk label, by Dave Buick. The band released its self-titled debut album in 1999, and a year later the album was followed up by the cult classicDe Stijl. The album eventually peaked at No. 38 in Billboard's Independent Albums chart when the band had established their popularity. While performing and in music videos, Jack and Meg are very recognisable visually, as they dress only in red, white, and black. In 2001 the band released White Blood Cells. The album's stripped-down garage rock sound drew critical acclaim in the UK and soon afterward in the US, making The White Stripes one of the more acclaimed bands of 2002. The album was followed up in 2003 by the commercially and critically successfulElephant. Allmusic wrote that the album \"sounds even more pissed-off, paranoid and stunning than its predecessor ... darker and more difficult than White Blood Cells. \" The album's first single, \"Seven Nation Army\", was the band's most successful. The band's fifth album, Get Behind Me Satan, was recorded in White's own home and marked a change in the band's musical direction, with piano-driven melodies and experimentation with marimba and a more rhythm-based guitar playing by White. The band's sixth album Icky Thump, released in 2007, entered the UK Albums Chart at number one and debuted at number two on the Billboard 200. The album's sound also included more punk, garage and blues influences than its predecessor. In late 2007, the band announced the cancellation of 18 tour dates due to Meg White's acute anxiety problems. White had revealed plans to release a seventh, as of yet untitled album in the summer of 2009. However, this has yet to happen. The band also made their first live appearance since Meg's anxiety problems in September 2007 on the final episode of Late Night with Conan O'Brien on February 20, 2009. A documentary, The White Stripes: Under Great White Northern Lights, about the band's 2007 tour, in which they played a gig in every Canadian province and territory, appeared in the 2009 Toronto International Film Festival. In July 2007, The White Stripes made history by playing the shortest concert ever only playing one note, in St John's, Newfoundland. They played a full show later that night at the Mile One Centre in downtown St. John's. On February 2, 2011, it was reported on the main page of whitestripes.com that the duo has decided to part ways. White stated that it was not due to health issues or artistic differences but there were a \"myriad of reasons\". \n\nThe Raconteurs:\nWhite formed The Raconteurs in 2005 along with Brendan Benson, Jack Lawrence and Patrick Keeler. The origin of the band was the song 'Steady, As She Goes' which White wrote along with Benson. This inspired them to create a full band with the addition of Lawrence and Keeler. The band came together in Detroit during 2005 and, for the remainder of the year, recorded when time allowed. The band's debut album Broken Boy Soldiers was recorded at Benson's home in Detroit. The band set out on tour to support the album, including eight dates as the opening act for Bob Dylan. The group's second album, Consolers of the Lonely, and its first single, \"Salute Your Solution\", simultaneously in 2008. The album received a Grammy nomination. \n\nThe Dead Weather:\n\nIn early 2009, Jack White formed a new group called The Dead Weather with The Kills frontwoman Alison Mosshart. White takes drum and vocal duties, while The Raconteurs bassist Jack Lawrence and Queens of the Stone Age keyboardist and guitarist Dean Fertita round the four piece out. The group debuted a handful of new tracks on March 11, 2009 in Nashville from their debut album Horehound, which came out July 13, 2009 in Europe and July 14, 2009 in North America, on White's Third Man Records label. On October 16, 2009, Mosshart confirmed that the second album was \"halfway done\". The first single \"Die by the Drop\" was released on March 30, 2010. The new album, Sea of Cowards was released on May 7 in Ireland, then on May 11, 2010, in the U.S. and May 10 in the United Kingdom, and again, on White's Third Man Records. \n\nSolo career:\nIt was rumored that in 2003 White collaborated on Electric Six's song \"Danger! High Voltage.\" Both he and the Electric Six denied this, and the vocal work was credited officially to John S O'Leary. However, a recent radio interview with Tim Shaw on Kerrang! 105.2 in the UK had Electric Six lead singer Dick Valentine talking openly about White singing on this song as well as speculating on the amount of money he was paid ($60,000). Also, a Q magazine article stated that Jack White did in fact work with Electric Six on the song \"Gay Bar\". In 2008, White collaborated with Alicia Keys on the song \"Another Way to Die\", the theme song for the James Bond film Quantum of Solace. He performed five songs for the Cold Mountain soundtrack; \"Sittin' on Top of the World\", \"Wayfaring Stranger\", \"Never Far Away\", \"Christmas Time Soon Will Be Over\" and \"Great High Mountain\". In 2009, Jack White was featured in It Might Get Loud, a film in which he, Jimmy Page, and The Edge come together to discuss the electric guitar and each artist's different playing methods. White's first solo single, \"Fly Farm Blues,\" was written and recorded in 10 minutes during the filming of the movie, in August 2009. The single went on sale as a 7-inch vinyl record from Third Man Records and as a digital single available through iTunes on August 11. In November 2010, producer Danger Mouse announced that White has been recruited for his collaboration with Daniele Luppi entitled Rome along with Norah Jones. White provided vocals to three songs on the album: \"The Rose with the Broken Neck,\" \"Two Against One\" and \"The World.\" The song \"You Know That I Know\", finished and performed by White, was featured on The Lost Notebooks of Hank Williams, released on October 4, 2011. On January 30, 2012 White released \"Love Interruption\" as the first single of his debut solo album, Blunderbuss, which was released on April 24, 2012. On March 3, 2012, he appeared on Saturday Night Live as the musical guest, with Lindsay Lohan hosting. He'll be playing selected dates in the summer, with festivals such as Radio 1's Hackney Weekend, Sasquatch! Music Festival, Fuji Rock Festival in Japan, one of the biggest festivals in the world, Rock Werchter in Belgium, and later in the year, he'll be headlining Austin City Limits Music Festival. For his solo shows, White tours with two bands. One, The Peacocks, is all-female, and the other, The Buzzards (sometimes called Los Buzzardos), is all-male. \n\nMusical equipment and sound:\nThe guitars White uses live are two 1965 JB Hutto Montgomery Airlines (one which he received from a fan), a three pickup Airline Town & Country (used on tour with the Raconteurs and in the \"Steady As She Goes\" music video), a Harmony Rocket, a 1970s-era Crestwood Astral II, 1950s-era Kay Hollowbody (given to him by his brother in return for a favor), a Gretsch White Penguin (as seen in the music video for Icky Thump), and a custom Gretsch Rancher Falcon acoustic guitar. When playing with the Raconteurs, White usually plays two custom Gretsch-styled copies of the Duo Jet double-cutaway guitar, which were made in collaboration with his Seattle luthier, Randy Parsons. His main guitar is dubbed the Triple Jet, which is made of copper and features a Gretsch logo from 1912. For their first tour, Jack also played Gretsch Anniversary Jr. with a Bigsby vibrato tailpiece and three Filtertron pickups. He also uses a Gretsch Rancher acoustic guitar and he now uses a custom Gretsch Anniversary Jr. with two cutaways, a built-in retractable microphone, and a theremin next to the Bigsby. Jack has dubbed this one the \"Triple Green Machine\". Also, he plays occasionally with his Gretsch Rancher, a Gibson J-160E. Also, he plays a Gretsch Duo Jet in Cadillac Green. Recently, he has featured his latest Gretsch, a custom white Billy Gibbons/Bo Diddley signature Gretsch Jupiter Thunderbird in the music video for \"Another Way to Die\", this guitar is also used on his concerts with The Dead Weather, but he also uses a black left-handed one since Sea of Cowards came out. He has also been known to play Fender Telecasters, featuring one in the music video for Loretta Lynn's \"Portland, Oregon\". Jack White has also played in live shows, mainly with The Dead Weather, a Daddy Mojo Stove Pipe Cigar Box Guitar. White uses numerous effects to create his live sound, most notably a DigiTech Whammy WH-4 to create the rapid modulations in pitch he uses in his solos. In concert with an MXR Micro Amp and custom Electro-Harmonix Big Muff Distortion/Sustainer, White can produce a very distinctive sound. In 2005, for the single \"Blue Orchid,\" White employed a new Electro-Harmonix creation, the Polyphonic Octave Generator (POG). Similar to (but more versatile than) the Whammy IV, the POG lets the user mix in several octave effects into one along with the dry signal. He also has three Z.Vex Tremolo Probes, that are hand painted black. All of the pedals that he uses live have been professionally painted red to match his red/black/white color scheme (with the exception of his Whammy and the other pedals that are already red). He plugs this setup into a 1970s Fender Twin Reverb and two 100-Watt Sears Silvertone 6x10 combo amplifiers. He also has a Sonic Machine Factory 15 Watt amp in red that can be seen in Under Great White Northern Lights. He uses this as a travel amp for secret or small shows, and also as the amp for his various keyboards when playing for a larger audience. With the Raconteurs, he has many more unusual pedals. And also, for the Raconteurs' 2008 tour, he had all of his pedals copper plated by Analog Man. White also produces a \"fake\" bass tone by playing the Kay Hollowbody and JB Hutto Montgomery Airline guitars through a Whammy IV set to one octave down for a very thick, low, rumbling sound, which he uses most notably on the songs \"Seven Nation Army\" and \"The Hardest Button to Button\" during live performances. On occasion, White also plays other instruments, such as a Black Gibson F-4 mandolin (\"Little Ghost\"), piano (on most tracks from Get Behind Me Satan, and various others), and an electric piano on such tracks as \"The Air Near My Fingers\" and \"I'm Finding it Harder to be a Gentleman\". White also plays percussion instruments such as the marimba (as on \"The Nurse\"), drums and tambourine. For the White Stripes' 2007 tour, he played a custom-finish Hammond A-100 organ with a Leslie 3300 speaker, which was subsequently loaned to Bob Dylan, and currently resides at Third Man Studios. On Broken Boy Soldiers, he is credited as playing the album's synths and organ; however, bandmate Brendan Benson also received credit for these instruments and it is unclear who played on which song. With the Dead Weather, Jack plays a custom Ludwig Classic Maple kit in Black Oyster Pearl. The sizes consist of the following: 16x26 kick, 5x16 snare (primary) 12x14 marching snare (secondary), 7x16 rack tom 14x16 floor tom, two 16x16 floor toms, Paiste 2002 24\"crash, 24\"ride and two 16\" crashes as hi-hats. For the 2009 Full Flash Blank tour, Jack used a drum head with the Three Brides of Dracula on the front, but in 2010, Jack employs a new drum head, upon the release of Sea of Cowards, which has an image of The Third Man himself: Harry Lime attempting to escape certain capture in the sewers of Vienna. During the American leg of the 2010 tour, Jack switched his drum head again featuring a picture of himself in the guise he wore on the cover of Sea of Cowards. This drum head is called Sam Kay by some fans, referring to the insert inside of the 12\" LP. In 2010, Jack White added an acoustic guitar to his collection named Veronica Lake. It is a custom white Gretsch Rancher with a gold double pickguard and a picture of Veronica Lake on the back. He is currently playing it with his band The Dead Weather. It is the newest addition to \"Jack's Girlfriends\" which already include Claudette Colbert that he plays In the Raconteurs, and Rita Hayworth that he plays in the White Stripes. According to Joe Chiccarelli, engineer for Icky Thump, White is not very technical when it comes to capturing his sound on record: \"Usually he wouldn't talk in terms of compression or EQ or any of those things, it was always about what can we do to give something more aggression or hit you in the face more. Jack's brilliance is his understanding of great emotional performances, and of what it takes to make something come alive through the speakers and have an impact.\" \n\nPersonal life:\n\nWhite gives few interviews and reveals few details of his private life. He states that he does not consider it relevant to his art, saying \"It's the same thing as asking Michelangelo, 'What kind of shoes do you wear?'...In the end, it doesn't really matter ... the only thing that's going to be left is our records and photos.\" A topic of intrigue has been the actual relationship between Jack and Meg White. In early interviews, the pair presented themselves as siblings, two of ten. The Flaming Lips touch on this in their song \"Thank You Jack White (for the Fiber-Optic Jesus That You Gave Me)\" released on their 2003 EP Fight Test. However, the Detroit Free Press produced copies of both a marriage license and divorce certificate, confirming Jack and Meg's history as a married couple. Neither addresses the truth officially and over time, they have become less verbal about the origins of their relationship. Jack White has said, though, that siblings are \"mated for life\", thus such relationships distract less from the music. Jack mentions them being brother and sister in the documentary Under Great White Northern Lights. In the early 1990s, Meg White worked as a bartender at Memphis Smoke, a bar in downtown Royal Oak (a Detroit suburb), where she first met Jack, then still known under his original surname 'Gillis'. They were married on September 21, 1996 and were divorced on March 24, 2000. Jack took her last name. White is often referred to as eccentric. For instance, he has an obsession with the number three. On November 7, 2005, it was widely reported that White had changed his name to \"Three Quid\" (quid is British slang for pound sterling). However, most reports indicated that this would only last until the end of the tour. On December 13, 2003, White was involved in an altercation with Jason Stollsteimer, lead singer of The Von Bondies, at the Magic Stick, a Detroit club. White was charged with misdemeanor aggravated assault. He pleaded guilty to the lesser charge of assault and battery, and was fined $750 (including court costs), and was sentenced to take anger management classes. In 2003, White made his acting debut in Mutant Swinger from Mars, and had a brief but highly publicized romantic relationship with actress Ren√©e Zellweger, whom he met during the filming of Cold Mountain. That summer, the couple were in a car accident in which White broke his left index finger and was forced to reschedule much of the summer tour. He posted the footage of his finger surgery on the web for fans. White and Zellweger's breakup became public in December 2004. White met British model Karen Elson (twin sister of Kate Elson) when she appeared in The White Stripes music video for \"Blue Orchid\". The video's director, Floria Sigismondi, noted \"you sensed an energy between them\". They married on June 1, 2005 in Manaus, Brazil. The wedding took place in a canoe on the Amazon River and was officiated by a shaman. A Roman Catholic priest later convalidated their marriage. Manager Ian Montone was the best man and Meg White was the maid of honor. Official wedding announcements stated that \"it was the first marriage\" for both. On May 2, 2006, the couple had a daughter, Scarlett Teresa White. Their second child, Henry Lee White, was born on August 7, 2007. The White family resides in Brentwood, Tennessee, a suburb south of Nashville, where Elson managed a vintage clothing store called Venus & Mars. The couple announced their divorce in June 2011, throwing a divorce party to celebrate their sixth anniversary and the \"making and breaking of the sacred union of marriage,\" according to the invitation sent to guests. In a press statement, the couple vowed to remain \"dear and trusted friends and co-parents.\" It is rumored that Karen Elson is \"Mildred\" of the Third Man Records produced album, \"Mildred and The Mice\". In 2006, it was revealed in the Sunday Times Rich List that White and his British wife Elson had a joint fortune of at least ¬£20 million (US$37 million). This ranked them at seventh place in the list of entertainers under age 30 who were born or live in the United Kingdom, ahead of the likes of Orlando Bloom and Kate Winslet. \n\nTV appearances:\nOn January 9, 2012, Jack White appeared on American Pickers. In the episode Jack trades his photo booth, first Jukebox, and US$6,000 for a taxidermy elephant head. Jack White appeared as a guest of The Colbert Report in three consecutive episodes in 2011 (June 21-23), and again on April 26, 2012.",

"text": "Green Day is an American punk rock band formed in 1987. The band consists of lead vocalist and guitarist Billie Joe Armstrong, bassist and backing vocalist Mike Dirnt, and drummer Tre Cool. Cool replaced former drummer John Kiffmeyer in 1990, prior to the recording of the band's second studio album, Kerplunk (1992). Green Day was originally part of the punk scene at 924 Gilman Street in Berkeley, California. The band's early releases were from the independent record label Lookout! Records. In 1994, its major label debut Dookie released through Reprise Records became a breakout success and eventually sold over 10 million copies in the U.S. Green Day was widely credited, alongside fellow California punk bands Sublime,The Offspring and Rancid, with popularizing and reviving mainstream interest in punk rock in the United States. Green Day's three follow-up albums, Insomniac (1995), Nimrod (1997), and Warning (2000) did not achieve the massive success of Dookie, though they were still successful, with Insomniac and Nimrod reaching double platinum and Warning reaching gold status. The band's rock opera, American Idiot (2004), reignited the band's popularity with a younger generation, selling five million copies in the United States. The band's eighth studio album, 21st Century Breakdown, was released in 2009 which achieved the band's best chart performance to date. The band will begin to release a trilogy of albums called ¬°Uno!, ¬°Dos!, and ¬°Tr√©!, to be released September 25, 2012, November 13, 2012, and January 15, 2013 respectively. Green Day has sold over 65 million records worldwide with 25 million in the US alone. The group has won five Grammy Awards: Best Alternative Album for Dookie, Best Rock Album for American Idiot, Record of the Year for \"Boulevard of Broken Dreams\", Best Rock Album for the second time for 21st Century Breakdown and Best Musical Show Album for American Idiot: The Original Broadway Cast Recording. In 2010, a stage adaptation of American Idiot debuted on Broadway. The musical was nominated for several Tony Awards, including Best Musical and Best Scenic Design. \n\nHistory:\n\nFormation and Lookout! years (1987-1993):\nIn 1987, friends Billie Joe Armstrong and Mike Dirnt, 15 years old at the time, formed a band called Sweet Children. Its first live performance took place on October 17, 1987 at Rod's Hickory Pit in Vallejo, California. In 1988, Armstrong and Dirnt began working with Sean Hughes and the former Isocracy drummer John Kiffmeyer, also known as \"Al Sobrante\". As said in the film Punk's Not Dead, Armstrong cites the band Operation Ivy (which featured Tim Armstrong and Matt Freeman of Rancid) as a major influence, and a group that inspired him to form a band. In 1988, Larry Livermore, owner of Lookout! Records, saw the band play an early show and signed the group to his label. In 1989, the band recorded its debut extended play, 1,000 Hours. Before 1,000 Hours was released, the group dropped the name Sweet Children; according to Livermore, this was done to avoid confusion with another local band Sweet Baby. The band adopted the name Green Day, due to their fondness for marijuana. Lookout! would release Green Day's debut studio album, 39/Smooth in early 1990. Green Day would record two extended plays later that year, Slappy and Sweet Children, the latter of which included older songs that the band had recorded for the Minneapolis independent record label Skene! Records. In 1991, Lookout! Records re-released 39/Smooth under the name 1,039/Smoothed Out Slappy Hours, and added the songs from the band's first two EPs, Slappy, and 1,000 Hours. In late 1990, shortly after the band's first nationwide tour, Sobrante left the East Bay area to attend college.The Lookouts drummer Tre Cool began filling in as a temporary replacement and later Cool's position as Green Day's drummer became permanent. The band went on tour for most of 1992 and 1993, and played a number of shows overseas in Europe. The band's second studio album Kerplunk sold 50,000 copies in the U.S. \n\nBreakthrough success (1994-1996):\n\nKerplunk's underground success led to a number of major record labels being interested in signing Green Day, and the band eventually left Lookout! and signed to Reprise Records after attracting the attention of producer Rob Cavallo. The group was impressed by his work with fellow Californian band The Muffs, and later remarked that Cavallo \"was the only person we could really talk to and connect with\". Reflecting on the period, Armstrong told Spin magazine in 1999, \"I couldn't go back to the punk scene, whether we were the biggest success in the world or the biggest failure ... The only thing I could do was get on my bike and go forward.\" After signing with Reprise, the band went to work on recording its major label debut, Dookie. Recorded in three weeks, and released in February 1994,Dookie became a commercial success, helped by extensive MTV airplay for the videos of the songs \"Longview\", \"Basket Case\", and \"When I Come Around\", all of which reached the number one position on the Modern Rock Tracks charts. That year, Green Day embarked on a nationwide tour with queercore band Pansy Division as its opening act. At a September 9, 1994 performance at Hatch Memorial Shell in Boston, mayhem broke-out during the band's set (cut short to seven songs) and by the end of the rampage, 100 people were injured and 45 arrested. The band also joined the lineups of both the Lollapalooza festival and Woodstock '94, where they started an infamous mud fight. During the concert, a security guard mistook bassist Mike Dirnt for a stage-invading fan and punched out some of his teeth. Viewed by millions by pay-per-view television, the Woodstock 1994 performance further aided Green Day's growing publicity and recognition, and helped push its album to eventual diamond status. In 1995, Dookie won the Grammy Award for Best Alternative Album and the band was nominated for nine MTV Video Music Awards including Video of the Year. In 1995, a new single for the Angus soundtrack was released, entitled \"J.A.R.\". The single debuted at number one on the Billboard Modern Rock Tracks chart. The song was followed by the band's fourth studio album, Insomniac, which was released in the fall of 1995. Insomniac was a much darker and heavier response to the band's newfound popularity, compared to the more melodic Dookie. The album opened to a warm critical reception, earning 4 out of 5 stars from Rolling Stone, which said \"In punk, the good stuff actually unfolds and gains meaning as you listen without sacrificing any of its electric, haywire immediacy. And Green Day are as good as this stuff gets.\" The singles released from Insomniac were \"Geek Stink Breath\", \"Stuck with Me\", \"Brain Stew/Jaded\", and \"Walking Contradiction\". Though the album did not approach the success of Dookie, it sold two million copies in the United States. In addition, the album won the band award nominations for Favorite Artist, Favorite Hard Rock Artist, and Favorite Alternative Artist at the 1996 American Music Awards, and the video for \"Walking Contradiction\" got the band a Grammy nomination for Best Video, Short Form, in addition to a Best Special Effects nomination at the MTV Video Music Awards. After that, the band abruptly cancelled a European tour, citing exhaustion. \n\nMiddle years and decline in commercial success (1997-2002):\nAfter a brief hiatus in 1996, Green Day began to work on a new album in 1997. From the outset, both the band and Cavallo agreed that the album had to be different from its previous albums. The result was Nimrod, an experimental deviation from the band's standard pop-punk brand of music. The new album was released in October 1997. It provided a variety of music, from pop-punk, surf rock, and ska, to an acoustic ballad. Nimrod entered the charts at number 10. The success of \"Good Riddance (Time of Your Life)\" won the band an MTV Video Award for Best Alternative Video. The song was also used in the second \"clip show\" episode of Seinfeld and on two episodes of ER. The other singles released from Nimrod were \"Nice Guys Finish Last\", \"Hitchin' a Ride\" and \"Redundant\". The band made a guest appearance in an episode of King of the Hill entitled \"The Man Who Shot Cane Skretteberg\", which aired in 1997. In late 1997 and most of 1998, Green Day embarked on a tour in support of Nimrod. In 2000, Green Day released its sixth studio album Warning. In support of the album, the band participated in the Warped Tour in 2000. The band also had an independent tour to support the album in 2001. Critics' reviews of the album were varied.Allmusic gave it 4.5/5 saying \"Warning may not be an innovative record per se, but it's tremendously satisfying.\"Rolling Stone was more critical, giving it 3/5, and saying \"Warning... invites the question: Who wants to listen to songs of faith, hope and social commentary from what used to be snot-core's biggest-selling band?\" Though it produced the hit \"Minority\" and a smaller hit with \"Warning\", some observers were coming to the conclusion that the band was losing relevance, and a decline in popularity followed. While all of Green Day's previous albums had reached a status of at least double platinum, Warning was only certified gold. At the 2001 California Music Awards, Green Day won all eight of the awards that it was nominated for. The group won the awards for Outstanding Album (Warning), Outstanding Punk Rock/Ska Album (Warning), Outstanding Group, Outstanding Male Vocalist, Outstanding Bassist, Outstanding Drummer, Outstanding Songwriter, and Outstanding Artist. The release of two compilation albums, International Superhits! and Shenanigans, followed Warning. International Superhits and its companion collection of music videos, International Supervideos!. Shenanigans contained some of the band's b-sides, including \"Espionage\", which was featured in the film Austin Powers: The Spy Who Shagged Me and was nominated for a Grammy Award for Best Rock Instrumental Performance. In the spring of 2002, Green Day co-headlined the Pop Disaster Tour with Blink-182 which was documented on the DVD Riding in Vans with Boys. \n\nAmerican Idiot and renewed success (2003-2006):\n\nIn the summer of 2003, the band went into a studio to write and record new material for a new album, tentatively titled Cigarettes and Valentines. After completing 20 tracks, the master recordings were stolen from the studio. Instead of re-recording the stolen tracks, the band decided to abandon the entire project and start over, considering the material to be unrepresentative of the band's best work. It was then revealed that a band called The Network was signed to Armstrong's record label Adeline Records with little fanfare and information. After the mysterious band released an album called Money Money 2020, it was rumored that The Network was a Green Day side project, due to the similarities in the bands' sounds. However, these rumors were never addressed by the band or Adeline Records, except for a statement on the Adeline website discussing an ongoing dispute between the two bands. Green Day collaborated with Iggy Pop on two tracks for his album Skull Ring in November 2003. On February 1, 2004 a new song, a cover of \"I Fought the Law\" made its debut on a commercial for iTunes during NFL Super Bowl XXXVIII. \n\nThe resulting album, American Idiot (2004), debuted at number one on the Billboard charts, the band's first album to reach number one, backed by the success of the album's first single, American Idiot. The album was labeled as a punk rock opera which follows the journey of the fictitious Jesus of Suburbia.American Idiot won the 2005 Grammy for Best Rock Album. The band also won a total of seven awards out of eight awards for which they were nominated, including the Viewer's Choice Award in MTV Video Music Awards 2005. Through 2005, the band toured in support of the album with nearly 150 dates (Longest tour in their career) visiting Japan, Australia, South America and the United Kingdom. While touring for American Idiot, they filmed and recorded the two concerts at the Milton Keynes National Bowl in England, which was voted 'The Best Show On Earth' in a Kerrang! Magazine Poll. These recordings were released as a live CD and DVD called Bullet in a Bible on November 15, 2005. This CD/DVD featured songs from American Idiot as well as songs from all its previous albums, except Kerplunk and 1,039/Smoothed Out Slappy Hours. The DVD featured behind-the-scenes footage of the band, and showed how the band prepared to put on the show. The final shows of its 2005 world tour were in Sydney and Melbourne in Australia, on December 14 and 17 respectively. On August 1, 2005, Green Day announced that it had rescinded the master rights to its pre-Dookie material from Lookout! Records, citing a continuing breach of contract regarding unpaid royalties, a complaint shared with other Lookout! bands. On January 10, 2006 the band was awarded with a People's Choice Award as favorite musical group or band. \n\n21st Century Breakdown and American Idiot: The Musical (2006-2010):\nGreen Day engaged in a number of other smaller projects in the time following the success of American Idiot. The group released an album under the name Foxboro Hot Tubs entitled Stop Drop and Roll!!!. In 2008, the Foxboro Hot Tubs went on a mini-tour to promote the record, hitting tiny Bay Area venues including the Stork Club in Oakland and Toot's Tavern in Crockett, CA. \n\nIn an interview with Carson Daly, Garbage lead singer Shirley Manson revealed that Butch Vig would be producing Green Day's forthcoming album. The span of nearly five years between American Idiot and 21st Century Breakdown was the longest gap between studio albums in Green Day's career. The band had been working on new material since January 2006. By October 2007, Armstrong had 45 songs written, but the band showed no further signs of progress until October 2008, when two videos showing the band recording in the studio with producer Butch Vig were posted on YouTube. The writing and recording process, spanning three years and four recording studios, was finally finished in April 2009. 21st Century Breakdown, was released on May 15, 2009. The album received a mainly positive reception from critics, getting an average rating between 3 and 4 stars. After the release, the album reached number one in fourteen countries, being certified gold or platinum in each. 21st Century Breakdown achieved Green Day's best chart performance to date. The band started playing shows in California in April and early May. It was their first live show in about three years. Green Day went on a world tour that started in North America in July 2009 and continuing around the world throughout the rest of 2009 and early 2010.Wal-Mart refused to carry the album as it contains a Parental Advisory sticker and requested that Green Day release a censored edition. The band members did not wish to change any lyrics on the album and responded by stating, \"There's nothing dirty about our record... They want artists to censor their records in order to be carried in there. We just said no. We've never done it before. You feel like you're in 1953 or something.\" In 2009, the band met with award-winning director Michael Mayer and many cast and crew members of the Tony Award-winning musical Spring Awakening to create a stage version of the album American Idiot.American Idiot: The Musical opened in the Berkeley Repertory Theatre during the end of 2009. The show features an expanded story of the original album, with new characters such as Will, Extraordinary Girl, and Favorite Son. On April 20, 2010, American Idiot: The Musical opened on Broadway, and Green Day released the soundtrack to the musical, featuring a new song by Green Day entitled \"When It's Time\". In June 2010 the iTunes received the single \"When It's Time\". During the Spike TV Video Game Awards 2009, it was announced that Green Day was set to have its own Rock Band video game titled as Green Day: Rock Band, as a follow-up to the last band specific Rock Band game, The Beatles: Rock Band. The game features the full albums of Dookie, American Idiot, and 21st Century Breakdown as well as select songs from the rest of Green Day's discography. During the second leg of the 21st Century Breakdown World Tour the band had said that they are writing new material. In an interview with Kerrang! magazine, Armstrong spoke about the possible new album: \"We did some demos in Berlin, some in Stockholm, some just outside of Glasgow and some in Amsterdam. We wanted get the songs down in some early form.\" The band also stated that they were recording a live album during the entire tour on the last date of the tour in Mountain View, California, also before playing the song \"Cigarettes and Valentines\". In October 2010, Dirnt was interviewed by Radio W, mentioning that they have completed the writing process of the ninth studio album. In the interview, Dirnt also mentioned that a new live album will \"most likely\" be released. The live CD/DVD and CD/Blu-ray entitled Awesome as Fuck was released on March 22, 2011. \n\n¬°Uno!, ¬°Dos!, and ¬°Tr√©! (2011-present):\nOn August 11, 2011, Green Day played a secret show in Costa Mesa, California, and performed an entire set of over 15 new songs allegedly for a possible upcoming album. Green Day put a news post on their official website which read \"Thanks everyone for coming out to the show...\" and \"Stay tuned for more\". It also included lyrics to a new song that was played at the show called \"Amy\" which is dedicated to Amy Winehouse, who died weeks before the show. In February 2012, Armstrong announced through Twitter that the band were in the studio, recording material for a new album. On February 24, 2012, the band began uploading behind the scenes videos of the recording of the new album to YouTube. On April 11, singer Billie Joe Armstrong announced that Green Day would be releasing a trilogy of albums called ¬°Uno!, ¬°Dos!, and ¬°Tr√©!. Armstrong stated that they would be released on September 25, 2012, November 13, 2012, and January 15, 2013 respectively. On June 14, 2012, Green Day released the official artwork of the album ¬°Uno! on YouTube and Facebook. Armstrong in a talk with Rolling Stone Magazine confirmed that each album will have a member of the band on its cover. The ¬°Uno! ¬°Dos! ¬°Tr√©! Ultimate Box Set has also been announced by Warner Bros. Records and will contain all three albums, as well as various other content, such as three digital singles and a one year online membership or renewal to the Idiot Club. The band played at the Rock En Seine festival in France on August 24-26, 2012, the Rock am See festival in Germany on September 1, 2012 and the Reading festival in the UK. The band has also announced a US tour supporting the trilogy, from November 2012 through February 2013. ¬°Uno! was released on September 24, 2012 and has been met with generally favorable reviews. \n\nMusical style and influences:\n\nGreen Day's sound is often compared to first wave punk bands such as the Ramones, The Clash, Sex Pistols, and the Buzzcocks. Citing the band's musical style prevalent on Dookie, Stephen Erlewine of Allmusic described Green Day as \"punk revivalists who recharged the energy of speedy, catchy three-chord punk-pop songs.\" While Armstrong is the primary songwriter, he looks to the other band members for organizational help. Billie Joe Armstrong has mentioned that some of his biggest influences are seminal alternative rock bands H√ºsker D√º and The Replacements, and that their influence is particularly noted in the band's chord changes in songs. Green Day has covered H√ºsker D√º's \"Don't Want to Know If You Are Lonely\" as a b-side to the \"Warning\" single, and the character \"Mr. Whirly\" in their song \"Misery\" is a reference to the Replacements song of the same name. Among other influences, Green Day have also cited The Who and power pop pioneers Cheap Trick. The band has generated controversy over whether the band's musical style and major-label status constitutes as \"true punk\". In reaction to both the style of music and the background of the band, John Lydon, former front man of the 1970s punk band the Sex Pistols commented: \n\"So there we are fending off all that and it pisses me off that years later a wank outfit like Green Day hop in and nick all that and attach it to themselves. They didn't earn their wings to do that and if they were true punk they wouldn't look anything like they do.\" \nArmstrong himself has discussed the group's status of being a punk band on a major record label, saying \"Sometimes I think we've become totally redundant because we're this big band now, we've made a lot of money - we're not punk rock any more. But then I think about it and just say, 'You can take us out of a punk rock environment, but you can't take the punk rock out of us.'\" English rock musician Noel Gallagher of Oasis also complained about the band semi-jokingly, claiming that they ripped off his song \"Wonderwall\" with their song \"Boulevard of Broken Dreams\". \n\nRelated projects:\nSince 1991, members of the band have branched out past Green Day and have started other projects with other musicians. Notable related projects of Green Day include Billie Joe Armstrong's Pinhead Gunpowder (which also features Green Day's live back-up guitarist Jason White), The Frustrators in which Mike Dirnt plays bass, and The Network, a collaboration between Green Day and members of the band, Devo in which all members play under fake stage names. Green Day has also released an album titled Stop Drop and Roll!!! on May 20, 2008, under the name Foxboro Hot Tubs, they currently use this name to book secret shows. In late December 2011, Armstrong formed a new side band called The Boo along his wife Adrienne and their two sons. In September 2006, Green Day collaborated with U2 and producer Rick Rubin to record a cover of the song \"The Saints Are Coming\", originally recorded by The Skids, with an accompanying video. The song was recorded to benefit Music Rising, an organization to help raise money for musicians' instruments lost during Hurricane Katrina, and to bring awareness on the eve of the one year anniversary of the disaster. In December 2006, Green Day and NRDC opened a web site in partnership to raise awareness on America's dependency on oil. Green Day released a cover of the John Lennon song \"Working Class Hero\", which was featured on the album Instant Karma: The Amnesty International Campaign to Save Darfur. The band performed the song on the season finale of American Idol. The song was nominated for a Grammy Award in 2008, though lost to The White Stripes' \"Icky Thump\". That summer, the band appeared in a cameo role in The Simpsons Movie, where they perform the show's theme song. Their version was released as a single on July 24, 2007. In 2009, the band collaborated with theatre director Michael Mayer to adapt their rock opera American Idiot into a one-act stage musical that premiered at the Berkeley Rep on September 15, 2009. The show then moved to Broadway on April 20, 2010. The reviews of American Idiot: The Musical have been positive to mixed. Charles Isherwood of The New York Times wrote an enthusiastic review for the Broadway production. He called the show \"a pulsating portrait of wasted youth that invokes all the standard genre conventions ... only to transcend them through the power of its music and the artistry of its execution, the show is as invigorating and ultimately as moving as anything I've seen on Broadway this season. Or maybe for a few seasons past.\" Jed Gottlieb of the Boston Herald enjoyed the premise of the show but found that \"the music and message suffer in a setting where the audience is politely, soberly seated\". Michael Kuchiwara of the Associated Press found the show to be \"visually striking and musically adventurous\", but noted that \"the show has the barest wisp of a story and minimal character development\". Paul Kolnik in USA Today enjoyed the contradiction that Green Day's \"massively popular, starkly disenchanted album ... would be the feel-good musical of the season\". Time magazine's Richard Zoglin opined that the score \"is as pure a specimen of contemporary punk rock as Broadway has yet encountered yet there's enough variety. ... Where the show fall short is as a fully developed narrative.\" He concluded that \"American Idiot, despite its earnest huffing and puffing, remains little more than an annotated rock concert. ... Still, it deserves at least two cheers - for its irresistible musical energy and for opening fresh vistas for that odd couple, rock and Broadway.\" Peter Travers from Rolling Stone, in his review of American Idiot, wrote \"Though American Idiot carries echoes of such rock musicals as Tommy, Hair, Rent and Spring Awakening, it cuts its own path to the heart. You won't know what hit you. American Idiot knows no limits--it's a global knockout.\" The musical has been nominated for a number of Tony Awards, including Best Musical and Best Scenic Design. It was also nominated for a number of Drama Desk Awards and Outer Critics Circle Awards. In October 2009, a Green Day art project was exhibited at StolenSpace Gallery in London. The exhibition showed artworks created for each of the songs on 21st Century Breakdown, was supported by the band, and led by their manager Pat Magnarella. He explained in an interview that \"Artists are basically like rock bands. Most are creating their art, but don't know how to promote it.\" For Billie Joe Armstrong, \"Many of the artists... show their work on the street, and we feel a strong connection to that type of creative expression.\" On April 13, 2011, a film version of American Idiot was confirmed. Michael Mayer, director of the Broadway musical, will be directing the film. It will be produced by Green Day, Pat Magnarella (Green Day's manager who also produced Bullet in a Bible, Awesome as Fuck, and Heart Like a Hand Grenade), Playtone (Tom Hanks and Gary Goetzman) and Tom Hulce. \n\nInvolvement in politics and social justice:\nWhen asked his opinion regarding whether all musicians ought to try to add a social or political message to their work, Armstrong replied that \" \nThe only people who should sing about social issues or politics are the ones who aren't full of shit. \n\" \n American Idiot was released two months before former President of the United States George W. Bush was reelected, and as a result the album became protest art. Created as an anti-war album, American Idiot contains many new-age protest songs, like Holiday which was against George Bush's decision to invade Iraq. Armstrong described the song as a means by which \"to battle your way out of your own ignorance\". \n\nBand members:\n\nCurrent members \nBillie Joe Armstrong - lead vocals, guitar, piano, harmonica (1987-present), \nMike Dirnt - bass, backing vocals (1988-present), rhythm guitar (1987-1988), \nTr√© Cool - drums, percussion, backing vocals (1990-present), \nSession and touring members \nJason White - lead and rhythm guitars, backing vocals (1999-present), \nJason Freese - keyboards, piano, saxophone, trombone, backing vocals (2003-present), \nJeff Matika - rhythm guitar, acoustic guitar, backing vocals (2009-present), \n\nFormer members \nJohn Kiffmeyer - drums, percussion (1987-1990), \nSean Hughes - bass (1987-1988), \nFormer touring members \nTimmy Chunks - guitars (1997-1999), \nGarth Schultz - trombone, trumpet (1997-1999), \nGabrial McNair - trombone, tenor saxophone (1999-2001), \nJeanne Geiger - trombone (2001), \nKurt Lohmiller - trumpet, timpani, percussion, backing vocals (1999-2004), \nMike Pelino - rhythm guitar, backing vocals (2004-2005), \nRonnie Blake - trumpet, timpani, percussion, backing vocals (2004-2005)",

"text": "Green Day is an American rock trio formed in 1987. The band has consisted of Billie Joe Armstrong (vocals, guitar), Mike Dirnt (bass guitar, vocals), and Tr√© Cool (drums, percussion) for the majority of its existence.  Green Day was originally part of the punk rock scene at 924 Gilman Street, Berkeley in  East Bay, CA, United States . Its early releases for independent record label Lookout! Records earned them a grassroots fanbase, some of whom felt alienated when the band signed to a major label. Nevertheless, its major label debut Dookie (1994) became a breakout success and eventually sold over 10 million copies in the US. and 15 million worldwide. As a result, Green Day was widely credited, alongside fellow California punk bands The Offspring and Rancid, with reviving mainstream interest in and popularizing punk rock in the United States. Green Day's three follow-up albums, Insomniac, Nimrod and Warning did not achieve the massive success of Dookie, but they were still successful, reaching double platinum, double platinum, and gold status respectively. Green Day's 2004 rock opera American Idiot reignited the band's popularity with a younger generation, selling five million copies in the U.S.The band's eighth studio album, 21st Century Breakdown, was released on May 15, 2009.  Green Day has sold over 22 million records in the United States.They have won three Grammy Awards; Best Alternative Album for Dookie, Best Rock Album for American Idiot, and Record of the Year for Boulevard of Broken Dreams.  In 1987, friends Billie Joe Armstrong and Mike Dirnt, 15 years old at the time, formed a band called Sweet Children. The first Sweet Children show took place on October 17, 1987, at Rod's Hickory Pit in Vallejo, California where Armstrong's mother was working.In 1988, Armstrong and Dirnt began working with former Isocracy drummer, John Kiffmeyer (also known as Al Sobrante). Kiffmeyer served as both the band's drummer and business manager, handling the booking of shows and helping the band establish a fan base.  Larry Livermore, owner of Lookout! Records, saw the band play an early show and signed them to his label. In 1989 they recorded their first EP, 1,000 Hours. Before 1,000 Hours was released, the band dropped the name Sweet Children, according to Livermore this was done in order to avoid confusion with another local band Sweet Baby.The band adopted the name Green Day, allegedly due to their fondness of marijuana.  Lookout! would release Green Day's first LP, 39/Smooth in early 1990. Green Day would record two EPs later that year: Slappy and Sweet Children, the latter of which included some older songs they had recorded for Minneapolis indie label Skene! Records. In 1991, Lookout! Records released 1,039/Smoothed Out Slappy Hours, a compilation of the 39/Smooth, Slappy, and 1,000 Hours EPs. In late 1990, shortly after the band's first nationwide tour, Sobrante left the East Bay area to attend college. The Lookouts drummer Tr√© Cool began filling in as a temporary replacement, and when it became clear that Sobrante did not plan on committing to the band full time, Tr√© Cool's position as Green Day's drummer became permanent. The band went on tour for most of 1992 and 1993, and played a stretch of shows overseas in Europe. The band's second full length album Kerplunk sold about 50,000 copies in the U.S., which was considered quite a large amount for the independent punk scene in 1992.  Kerplunk's underground success led to a wave of interest coming from major record labels, and eventually they left Lookout! on friendly terms and signed with Reprise Records after attracting the attention of producer Rob Cavallo. Signing to Reprise caused many punk rock fans to regard Green Day as sellouts.Reflecting on the period, Armstrong told SPIN magazine in 1999, \"I couldn't go back to the punk scene, whether we were the biggest success in the world or the biggest failure ... The only thing I could do was get on my bike and go forward.\" After signing with Reprise, the band went to work on recording its major label debut, Dookie.  \"Longview\" Play sound Sample of \"Longview\", the first single from Dookie, which combined a memorable bass line with a guitar riff and drums introduced in the chorus. Problems listening to this file? See media help.  \"Basket Case\" Play sound Sample of \"Basket Case\", the third single from Dookie, which was about Armstrong's panic attacks. Problems listening to this file? See media help.  Released in February 1994, and recorded in 3 weeks,Dookie became a commercial success, helped by extensive MTV airplay for the videos of the songs \"Longview\", \"Basket Case\", and \"When I Come Around\", all of which reached the number one position on the Modern Rock Tracks charts. That year, Green Day embarked on a nationwide tour with queercore band Pansy Division as its opening act. At a September 9, 1994 concert at Boston Esplanade, mayhem broke-out during the band's set (cut short to seven songs) and by the end of the rampage, 100 people were injured and 45 arrested. The band also joined the lineups of both the Lollapalooza festival and Woodstock 1994, where they started an infamous mud fight. During the concert, a security guard mistook bassist Mike Dirnt for a stage-invading fan and punched out some of his teeth. Viewed by millions via pay-per-view television, the Woodstock 1994 performance further aided Green Day's growing publicity and recognition, and helped push its album to eventual diamond status. In 1995, Dookie won the Grammy Award for Best Alternative Album and the band was nominated for 9 MTV Video Music Awards including Video of the Year. The full fold-out artwork to Insomniac, entitled God Told Me to Skin You Alive.  In 1995, a new single for the Angus soundtrack was released, titled \"J.A.R.\". The single went straight to number one on the Billboard Modern Rock Tracks chart. The song was followed by the band's new album, Insomniac, which was released in the fall of 1995. Insomniac was a much darker and heavier response by the band, compared to the poppier, more melodic Dookie. Insomniac opened to a warm critical reception, earning 4 out of 5 stars from Rolling Stone, which said \"In punk, the good stuff actually unfolds and gains meaning as you listen without sacrificing any of its electric, haywire immediacy. And Green Day are as good as this stuff gets.\"Insomniac used a piece of art by Winston Smith entitled God Told Me to Skin You Alive for its album cover. The singles released from Insomniac were \"Geek Stink Breath\", \"Brain Stew/Jaded\", \"Walking Contradiction\", and \"Stuck With Me\". Though the album did not approach the success of Dookie, it still sold two million copies in the United States.Insomniac won the band award nominations for Favorite Artist, Favorite Hard Rock Artist, and Favorite Alternative Artist at the 1996 American Music Awards, and the video for \"Walking Contradiction\" got the band a Grammy nomination for Best Video, Short Form, in addition to a Best Special Effects nomination at the MTV Video Music Awards.[20] After that, the band abruptly cancelled a European tour, citing exhaustion.  Middle era: 1997-2002  After taking a break in 1996, Green Day began to work on a new album in 1997. From the outset, both the band and Cavallo agreed that the album had to be different from its previous records.The result was Nimrod, an experimental deviation from the band's standard pop-punk brand of music. The new album was released in October 1997. It provided a variety of music, from pop-punk, surf rock, and ska, to an acoustic ballad. Nimrod entered the charts at number 10. The success of \"Good Riddance (Time of Your Life)\" won the band an MTV Video Award for Best Alternative Video for the song's video, which depicted people undergoing major changes in their lives while Billie Joe Armstrong strummed his acoustic guitar. The song was also used in the second \"clip show\" episode of Seinfeld and on two episodes of ER. The other singles released from Nimrod were \"Nice Guys Finish Last\", \"Hitchin' a Ride\" and \"Redundant\". The band made a guest appearance in an episode of King of the Hill entitled \"The Man Who Shot Cane Skretteberg\", which aired in 1997.  In 2000, Green Day released Warning, a step further in the style that they had hinted at with Nimrod. Critics' reviews of the album were varied.Allmusic gave it 4.5/5 saying \"Warning may not be an innovative record per se, but it's tremendously satisfying.\" Rolling Stone was more critical, giving it 3/5, and saying \"Warning... invites the question: Who wants to listen to songs of faith, hope and social commentary from what used to be snot-core's biggest-selling band?\" Though it produced the hit \"Minority\" and a smaller hit with \"Warning\", some observers were coming to the conclusion that the band was losing relevance,and a decline in popularity followed. While all of Green Day's past albums had reached a status of at least double platinum, Warning was only certified gold.  At the 2001 California Music Awards, Green Day won all eight awards that they were nominated for. They won the awards for Outstanding Album (Warning), Outstanding Punk Rock/Ska Album (Warning), Outstanding Group, Outstanding Male Vocalist, Outstanding Bassist, Outstanding Drummer, Outstanding Songwriter and Outstanding Artist  The release of a Greatest Hits compilation, International Superhits!, and an assemblage of B-sides, Shenanigans, followed Warning. International Superhits and its companion collection of music videos, International Supervideos!, sold reasonably well, going platinum in the U.S. Shenanigans contained some of the band's b-sides, including \"Espionage\" which was featured in Austin Powers: The Spy Who Shagged Me and was nominated for a Grammy for Best Rock Instrumental Performance.  In the spring of 2002, Green Day co-headlined the Pop Disaster Tour with Blink-182. Despite the co-headlining title, Green Day would play each show before Blink-182, who at the time were experiencing more success. The tour was documented on the DVD Riding In Vans With Boys.  American Idiot and renewed popularity: 2003-2006 Spectators watch Green Day from the grass slopes at the National Bowl.  In the summer of 2003 the band went into a studio to write and record new material for a new album, tentatively titled Cigarettes and Valentines. After completing 20 tracks, the master tapes were stolen from the studio. The band chose not to try to re-create the stolen album, but instead started over. By the end of 2003, Green Day collaborated with Iggy Pop on two tracks for his album Skull Ring. On February 1, 2004 a new song, a cover of \"I Fought the Law\" made its debut on a commercial for iTunes during NFL Super Bowl XXXVIII. The band underwent serious \"band therapy,\" engaging in several long talks to work out the members' differences after accusations from Dirnt and Cool that Armstrong was \"the band's Nazi\" and a show-off bent on taking the limelight from the other band members.  The resulting 2004 album, American Idiot, debuted at number one on the Billboard charts, the band's first ever album to top the chart, backed by the success of the album's first single, \"American Idiot.\" The album was billed as a \"punk rock opera\" which follows the journey of the fictitious \"Jesus of Suburbia\". American Idiot won the 2005 Grammy for \"Best Rock Album\" and the band swept the 2005 MTV music awards, winning a total of seven of the eight awards they were nominated for, including the coveted Viewer's Choice Award.  Through 2005, the band toured in support of the album with about 150 dates -- the longest tour in its career -- visiting Japan, Australia, South America and the United Kingdom, where they drew a crowd of 130,000 people over a span of two days. While touring for American Idiot, they filmed and recorded the two concerts at the Milton Keynes National Bowl in England, which was voted 'The Best Show On Earth' in a Kerrang! Magazine Poll.  These recordings were released as a live CD and DVD called Bullet in a Bible on November 15, 2005. This CD/DVD featured hits from American Idiot as well as a few songs from all its previous albums, except \"Kerplunk\" and \"1,039/Smoothed Out Slappy Hours\". The DVD featured behind-the-scenes footage of the band, and showed how the band prepared to put on the show. The final shows of its 2005 world tour were in Sydney, Australia, and Melbourne, Australia, on December 14 and 17 respectively. On January 10, 2006 the band was awarded with a People's Choice Award for favorite group. Green Day live in Germany during the American Idiot tour.  On August 1, 2005, Green Day announced that that it had rescinded the master rights to its pre-Dookie material from Lookout! Records, citing a continuing breach of contract regarding unpaid royalties, a complaint shared with other Lookout! bands. The pre-Dookie material, which remained out of print for about a year, was reissued by the band's current label, Reprise, on January 9, 2007.  In 2006, Green Day won the Grammy Award for Record of the Year for \"Boulevard of Broken Dreams\" which spent 16 weeks at the number one position of Billboard's Modern Rock Tracks, a record it shared along with Red Hot Chili Peppers' \"Scar Tissue\" and Staind's \"It's Been Awhile,\" (the record has been since been beaten by Foo Fighters' 2007 hit \"The Pretender\" which reigned at the top spot for 18 weeks).  Foxboro Hot Tubs and 21st Century Breakdown: 2007 onward  Green Day engaged in several other smaller projects in the time following the hype of American Idiot. In the spring of 2007, Green Day recorded a cover of the John Lennon song \"Working Class Hero\", which appeared on a compilation album \"Instant Karma\", that benefitted victims in Darfur. In the summer of 2007, Green Day recorded a version of The Simpsons theme song for The Simpsons Movie, as well as having an appearance in the movie.  Green Day recently released a new album under the name Foxboro Hot Tubs entitled Stop Drop and Roll!!!. In an interview with Kerrang!, Billie Joe revealed that 2008 would \"be a fair estimate of the release date of their new untitled eighth studio album.\"In a recent interview with Carson Daly, Garbage lead singer Shirley Manson revealed that Butch Vig would be producing Green Day's forthcoming album. In October 2008 Green Day returned to the studios with Butch Vig, to start recording the new studio album. Two videos showing the band in the studio were posted on YouTube. In the tour section of the band's official website, the message \"World Tour coming soon!\" is shown.In the December 9 issue of Alternative Press, in-depth details about the new album were released. According to the interview, Green Day are recording in the same studio as they did for American Idiot, Ocean Way Recording in Hollywood, California. \"This album is more... religious\", and is influenced by Bob Dylan, Bruce Springsteen, and The Beatles, to name a few.Billie Joe Armstrong said when he was being interviewed for Kerrang!'s readers poll, that it will be more power pop than punk rock.The new album is titled 21st Century Breakdown and was released worldwide on May 15, 2009. Green Day will be going on a world tour starting with North America in July, 2009 until sometime in 2010. Singles from 21st Century Breakdown include Know Your Enemy and 21 Guns.  Musical style and influences  Green Day's sound is often compared to first wave punk bands such as the Ramones, The Clash, Sex Pistols, The Jam, and the Buzzcocks. The majority of their song catalog is composed of distorted guitar, fast, manic drums, and relatively high-treble bass. Most of their songs are fast-paced and under four minutes. Billie Joe Armstrong has mentioned that some of his biggest influences are seminal alternative rock bands H√ºsker D√º and The Replacements, and that their influence is particularly noted in the band's chord changes in songs. In fact, Green Day has covered H√ºsker D√º's \"Don't Want to Know If You Are Lonely\" as a b-side for the \"Warning\" single, and the character \"Mr. Whirly\" in their song \"Misery\" is a reference to the Replacements song of the same name. Among other influences, Green Day have also cited Queen,proto-punks The Who, and power pop pioneers Cheap Trick [46]. Armstrong's lyrics commonly describe alienation, (\"Jesus of Suburbia\", \"Boulevard of Broken Dreams\", \"Road to Acceptance\", \"Disappearing Boy\", \"Castaway\") hysteria (\"Basket Case\", \"Panic Song\"), girls (\"She\", \"80\" \"Only of You\",\"Maria\" \"She's a Rebel\"), growing up (\"Longview\" and \"Welcome to Paradise\"), and the effects of doing drugs (\"Geek Stink Breath\", \"Green Day\"). The Ramones had similar lyrical themes such as hysteria (\"Anxiety\", \"Psycho Therapy\"), alienation (\"Outsider\", \"Something To Believe In\"), girls (\"I Wanna Be Your Boyfriend\", \"Sheena Is a Punk Rocker\"), and drugs (\"Now I Wanna Sniff Some Glue\", \"Chinese Rocks\"). Green Day has covered Ramones songs several times, including recording \"Outsider\" for the tribute album We're a Happy Family, and performing \"Blitzkrieg Bop\" and \"Teenage Lobotomy\" when the Ramones were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2002.  Criticism and controversy  Beginning with the release of Dookie, and the subsequent explosion of MTV airplay it received, Green Day has received considerable criticism from those who see the punk genre as a social movement independent of corporate sponsorship. With the release of American Idiot and the subsequent draw of many new fans, much of this criticism has been revived.  One of the more contentious issues is genre labeling. In reaction to both the style of music and the background of the band, many fans and musicians have taken heavy objection to the usage of the term \"punk\" when applied to Green Day. This is evidenced by the following comments issued by John Lydon (Johnny Rotten), former front man of both the 1970s punk band the Sex Pistols and the 1980s post-punk, Public Image Ltd.: \" So there we are fending off all that and it pisses me off that years later a wank outfit like Green Day hop in and nick all that and attach it to themselves. They didn't earn their wings to do that and if they were true punk they wouldn't look anything like they do. \"  Brandon Flowers of The Killers went on record in 2007 claiming that Green Day's politically driven concept album American Idiot displays \"calculated Anti-Americanism.\" He explained that he has problems with the album content itself and also the fact that the band's recent live DVD, Bullet in a Bible, was filmed in England. The taping of the concert, featured on Bullet in a Bible, shows thousands of Europeans singing along to \"American Idiot.\" Stating that he felt Green Day's DVD is a bit of a stunt, he said, \"I just thought it was really cheap. To go to a place like England or Germany and sing that song - those kids aren't taking it the same way that he meant it. And he (Billie Joe Armstrong) knew it.\"  More recently, Oasis guitarist Noel Gallagher has accused the band of ripping off his song \"Wonderwall\" for \"Boulevard of Broken Dreams\".  Related projects Main article: Green Day related projects  Ever since 1991, some members of the band have branched out past Green Day and have started other projects with other musicians. Notable related projects of Green Day include Billie Joe Armstrong's Pinhead Gunpowder (which also features Green Day's live backup guitarist Jason White), The Frustrators in which Mike Dirnt plays bass, and The Network, in which all three members of Green Day play under fake stage names. Billie Joe Armstrong has also confirmed that the main members of Green Day are in the band Foxboro Hot Tubs. A Foxboro Hot Tubs album titled Stop Drop and Roll!!! was released on 2008-05-20.  Charity projects that the band have been involved with include the collaboration with U2 (\"The Saints Are Coming\") to help raise money for musical instruments lost in Hurricane Katrina, and teaming with the Natural Resources Defense Council for the \"Move America Beyond Oil\" campaign and other environmental concerns.  In September 2006, Green Day teamed up with U2 and producer Rick Rubin to record a cover of the song \"The Saints Are Coming\", originally recorded by The Skids, with an accompanying video. The song is to benefit Music Rising, an organization to help raise money for musicians' instruments lost during Hurricane Katrina, and to bring awareness on the eve of the one year anniversary of the disaster.  \"Working Class Hero\" Play sound \"Working Class Hero\", a cover of a John Lennon song, was released on the Instant Karma CD. Problems listening to this file? See media help.  In December 2006, Green Day and NRDC opened a web site in partnership to raise awareness on America's dependency on oil. (See related projects.)  Green Day released a cover of the John Lennon song \"Working Class Hero\", that was featured on the album Instant Karma: The Amnesty International Campaign to Save Darfur. The band performed the song on the season finale of American Idol. The song was nominated for a Grammy in 2008, but lost to The White Stripes' \"Icky Thump\".  That summer, the band appeared in a cameo role in The Simpsons Movie, where they perform the show's theme song. Their version was released as a single on July 24, 2007.

"text": "Green Day is an American punk rock band formed in 1987. The band consists of lead vocalist and guitarist Billie Joe Armstrong, bassist and backing vocalist Mike Dirnt, and drummer Tre Cool. Cool replaced former drummer John Kiffmeyer in 1990, prior to the recording of the band's second studio album, Kerplunk (1992). Green Day was originally part of the punk scene at 924 Gilman Street in Berkeley, California. The band's early releases were from the independent record label Lookout! Records. In 1994, its major label debut Dookie released through Reprise Records became a breakout success and eventually sold over 10 million copies in the U.S. Green Day was widely credited, alongside fellow California punk bands Sublime,The Offspring and Rancid, with popularizing and reviving mainstream interest in punk rock in the United States. Green Day's three follow-up albums, Insomniac (1995), Nimrod (1997), and Warning (2000) did not achieve the massive success of Dookie, though they were still successful, with Insomniac and Nimrod reaching double platinum and Warning reaching gold status. The band's rock opera, American Idiot (2004), reignited the band's popularity with a younger generation, selling five million copies in the United States. The band's eighth studio album, 21st Century Breakdown, was released in 2009 which achieved the band's best chart performance to date. The band will begin to release a trilogy of albums called ¬°Uno!, ¬°Dos!, and ¬°Tr√©!, to be released September 25, 2012, November 13, 2012, and January 15, 2013 respectively. Green Day has sold over 65 million records worldwide with 25 million in the US alone. The group has won five Grammy Awards: Best Alternative Album for Dookie, Best Rock Album for American Idiot, Record of the Year for \"Boulevard of Broken Dreams\", Best Rock Album for the second time for 21st Century Breakdown and Best Musical Show Album for American Idiot: The Original Broadway Cast Recording. In 2010, a stage adaptation of American Idiot debuted on Broadway. The musical was nominated for several Tony Awards, including Best Musical and Best Scenic Design. \n\nHistory:\n\nFormation and Lookout! years (1987-1993):\nIn 1987, friends Billie Joe Armstrong and Mike Dirnt, 15 years old at the time, formed a band called Sweet Children. Its first live performance took place on October 17, 1987 at Rod's Hickory Pit in Vallejo, California. In 1988, Armstrong and Dirnt began working with Sean Hughes and the former Isocracy drummer John Kiffmeyer, also known as \"Al Sobrante\". As said in the film Punk's Not Dead, Armstrong cites the band Operation Ivy (which featured Tim Armstrong and Matt Freeman of Rancid) as a major influence, and a group that inspired him to form a band. In 1988, Larry Livermore, owner of Lookout! Records, saw the band play an early show and signed the group to his label. In 1989, the band recorded its debut extended play, 1,000 Hours. Before 1,000 Hours was released, the group dropped the name Sweet Children; according to Livermore, this was done to avoid confusion with another local band Sweet Baby. The band adopted the name Green Day, due to their fondness for marijuana. Lookout! would release Green Day's debut studio album, 39/Smooth in early 1990. Green Day would record two extended plays later that year, Slappy and Sweet Children, the latter of which included older songs that the band had recorded for the Minneapolis independent record label Skene! Records. In 1991, Lookout! Records re-released 39/Smooth under the name 1,039/Smoothed Out Slappy Hours, and added the songs from the band's first two EPs, Slappy, and 1,000 Hours. In late 1990, shortly after the band's first nationwide tour, Sobrante left the East Bay area to attend college.The Lookouts drummer Tre Cool began filling in as a temporary replacement and later Cool's position as Green Day's drummer became permanent. The band went on tour for most of 1992 and 1993, and played a number of shows overseas in Europe. The band's second studio album Kerplunk sold 50,000 copies in the U.S. \n\nBreakthrough success (1994-1996):\n\nKerplunk's underground success led to a number of major record labels being interested in signing Green Day, and the band eventually left Lookout! and signed to Reprise Records after attracting the attention of producer Rob Cavallo. The group was impressed by his work with fellow Californian band The Muffs, and later remarked that Cavallo \"was the only person we could really talk to and connect with\". Reflecting on the period, Armstrong told Spin magazine in 1999, \"I couldn't go back to the punk scene, whether we were the biggest success in the world or the biggest failure ... The only thing I could do was get on my bike and go forward.\" After signing with Reprise, the band went to work on recording its major label debut, Dookie. Recorded in three weeks, and released in February 1994,Dookie became a commercial success, helped by extensive MTV airplay for the videos of the songs \"Longview\", \"Basket Case\", and \"When I Come Around\", all of which reached the number one position on the Modern Rock Tracks charts. That year, Green Day embarked on a nationwide tour with queercore band Pansy Division as its opening act. At a September 9, 1994 performance at Hatch Memorial Shell in Boston, mayhem broke-out during the band's set (cut short to seven songs) and by the end of the rampage, 100 people were injured and 45 arrested. The band also joined the lineups of both the Lollapalooza festival and Woodstock '94, where they started an infamous mud fight. During the concert, a security guard mistook bassist Mike Dirnt for a stage-invading fan and punched out some of his teeth. Viewed by millions by pay-per-view television, the Woodstock 1994 performance further aided Green Day's growing publicity and recognition, and helped push its album to eventual diamond status. In 1995, Dookie won the Grammy Award for Best Alternative Album and the band was nominated for nine MTV Video Music Awards including Video of the Year. In 1995, a new single for the Angus soundtrack was released, entitled \"J.A.R.\". The single debuted at number one on the Billboard Modern Rock Tracks chart. The song was followed by the band's fourth studio album, Insomniac, which was released in the fall of 1995. Insomniac was a much darker and heavier response to the band's newfound popularity, compared to the more melodic Dookie. The album opened to a warm critical reception, earning 4 out of 5 stars from Rolling Stone, which said \"In punk, the good stuff actually unfolds and gains meaning as you listen without sacrificing any of its electric, haywire immediacy. And Green Day are as good as this stuff gets.\" The singles released from Insomniac were \"Geek Stink Breath\", \"Stuck with Me\", \"Brain Stew/Jaded\", and \"Walking Contradiction\". Though the album did not approach the success of Dookie, it sold two million copies in the United States. In addition, the album won the band award nominations for Favorite Artist, Favorite Hard Rock Artist, and Favorite Alternative Artist at the 1996 American Music Awards, and the video for \"Walking Contradiction\" got the band a Grammy nomination for Best Video, Short Form, in addition to a Best Special Effects nomination at the MTV Video Music Awards. After that, the band abruptly cancelled a European tour, citing exhaustion. \n\nMiddle years and decline in commercial success (1997-2002):\nAfter a brief hiatus in 1996, Green Day began to work on a new album in 1997. From the outset, both the band and Cavallo agreed that the album had to be different from its previous albums. The result was Nimrod, an experimental deviation from the band's standard pop-punk brand of music. The new album was released in October 1997. It provided a variety of music, from pop-punk, surf rock, and ska, to an acoustic ballad. Nimrod entered the charts at number 10. The success of \"Good Riddance (Time of Your Life)\" won the band an MTV Video Award for Best Alternative Video. The song was also used in the second \"clip show\" episode of Seinfeld and on two episodes of ER. The other singles released from Nimrod were \"Nice Guys Finish Last\", \"Hitchin' a Ride\" and \"Redundant\". The band made a guest appearance in an episode of King of the Hill entitled \"The Man Who Shot Cane Skretteberg\", which aired in 1997. In late 1997 and most of 1998, Green Day embarked on a tour in support of Nimrod. In 2000, Green Day released its sixth studio album Warning. In support of the album, the band participated in the Warped Tour in 2000. The band also had an independent tour to support the album in 2001. Critics' reviews of the album were varied.Allmusic gave it 4.5/5 saying \"Warning may not be an innovative record per se, but it's tremendously satisfying.\"Rolling Stone was more critical, giving it 3/5, and saying \"Warning... invites the question: Who wants to listen to songs of faith, hope and social commentary from what used to be snot-core's biggest-selling band?\" Though it produced the hit \"Minority\" and a smaller hit with \"Warning\", some observers were coming to the conclusion that the band was losing relevance, and a decline in popularity followed. While all of Green Day's previous albums had reached a status of at least double platinum, Warning was only certified gold. At the 2001 California Music Awards, Green Day won all eight of the awards that it was nominated for. The group won the awards for Outstanding Album (Warning), Outstanding Punk Rock/Ska Album (Warning), Outstanding Group, Outstanding Male Vocalist, Outstanding Bassist, Outstanding Drummer, Outstanding Songwriter, and Outstanding Artist. The release of two compilation albums, International Superhits! and Shenanigans, followed Warning. International Superhits and its companion collection of music videos, International Supervideos!. Shenanigans contained some of the band's b-sides, including \"Espionage\", which was featured in the film Austin Powers: The Spy Who Shagged Me and was nominated for a Grammy Award for Best Rock Instrumental Performance. In the spring of 2002, Green Day co-headlined the Pop Disaster Tour with Blink-182 which was documented on the DVD Riding in Vans with Boys. \n\nAmerican Idiot and renewed success (2003-2006):\n\nIn the summer of 2003, the band went into a studio to write and record new material for a new album, tentatively titled Cigarettes and Valentines. After completing 20 tracks, the master recordings were stolen from the studio. Instead of re-recording the stolen tracks, the band decided to abandon the entire project and start over, considering the material to be unrepresentative of the band's best work. It was then revealed that a band called The Network was signed to Armstrong's record label Adeline Records with little fanfare and information. After the mysterious band released an album called Money Money 2020, it was rumored that The Network was a Green Day side project, due to the similarities in the bands' sounds. However, these rumors were never addressed by the band or Adeline Records, except for a statement on the Adeline website discussing an ongoing dispute between the two bands. Green Day collaborated with Iggy Pop on two tracks for his album Skull Ring in November 2003. On February 1, 2004 a new song, a cover of \"I Fought the Law\" made its debut on a commercial for iTunes during NFL Super Bowl XXXVIII. \n\nThe resulting album, American Idiot (2004), debuted at number one on the Billboard charts, the band's first album to reach number one, backed by the success of the album's first single, American Idiot. The album was labeled as a punk rock opera which follows the journey of the fictitious Jesus of Suburbia.American Idiot won the 2005 Grammy for Best Rock Album. The band also won a total of seven awards out of eight awards for which they were nominated, including the Viewer's Choice Award in MTV Video Music Awards 2005. Through 2005, the band toured in support of the album with nearly 150 dates (Longest tour in their career) visiting Japan, Australia, South America and the United Kingdom. While touring for American Idiot, they filmed and recorded the two concerts at the Milton Keynes National Bowl in England, which was voted 'The Best Show On Earth' in a Kerrang! Magazine Poll. These recordings were released as a live CD and DVD called Bullet in a Bible on November 15, 2005. This CD/DVD featured songs from American Idiot as well as songs from all its previous albums, except Kerplunk and 1,039/Smoothed Out Slappy Hours. The DVD featured behind-the-scenes footage of the band, and showed how the band prepared to put on the show. The final shows of its 2005 world tour were in Sydney and Melbourne in Australia, on December 14 and 17 respectively. On August 1, 2005, Green Day announced that it had rescinded the master rights to its pre-Dookie material from Lookout! Records, citing a continuing breach of contract regarding unpaid royalties, a complaint shared with other Lookout! bands. On January 10, 2006 the band was awarded with a People's Choice Award as favorite musical group or band. \n\n21st Century Breakdown and American Idiot: The Musical (2006-2010):\nGreen Day engaged in a number of other smaller projects in the time following the success of American Idiot. The group released an album under the name Foxboro Hot Tubs entitled Stop Drop and Roll!!!. In 2008, the Foxboro Hot Tubs went on a mini-tour to promote the record, hitting tiny Bay Area venues including the Stork Club in Oakland and Toot's Tavern in Crockett, CA. \n\nIn an interview with Carson Daly, Garbage lead singer Shirley Manson revealed that Butch Vig would be producing Green Day's forthcoming album. The span of nearly five years between American Idiot and 21st Century Breakdown was the longest gap between studio albums in Green Day's career. The band had been working on new material since January 2006. By October 2007, Armstrong had 45 songs written, but the band showed no further signs of progress until October 2008, when two videos showing the band recording in the studio with producer Butch Vig were posted on YouTube. The writing and recording process, spanning three years and four recording studios, was finally finished in April 2009. 21st Century Breakdown, was released on May 15, 2009. The album received a mainly positive reception from critics, getting an average rating between 3 and 4 stars. After the release, the album reached number one in fourteen countries, being certified gold or platinum in each. 21st Century Breakdown achieved Green Day's best chart performance to date. The band started playing shows in California in April and early May. It was their first live show in about three years. Green Day went on a world tour that started in North America in July 2009 and continuing around the world throughout the rest of 2009 and early 2010.Wal-Mart refused to carry the album as it contains a Parental Advisory sticker and requested that Green Day release a censored edition. The band members did not wish to change any lyrics on the album and responded by stating, \"There's nothing dirty about our record... They want artists to censor their records in order to be carried in there. We just said no. We've never done it before. You feel like you're in 1953 or something.\" In 2009, the band met with award-winning director Michael Mayer and many cast and crew members of the Tony Award-winning musical Spring Awakening to create a stage version of the album American Idiot.American Idiot: The Musical opened in the Berkeley Repertory Theatre during the end of 2009. The show features an expanded story of the original album, with new characters such as Will, Extraordinary Girl, and Favorite Son. On April 20, 2010, American Idiot: The Musical opened on Broadway, and Green Day released the soundtrack to the musical, featuring a new song by Green Day entitled \"When It's Time\". In June 2010 the iTunes received the single \"When It's Time\". During the Spike TV Video Game Awards 2009, it was announced that Green Day was set to have its own Rock Band video game titled as Green Day: Rock Band, as a follow-up to the last band specific Rock Band game, The Beatles: Rock Band. The game features the full albums of Dookie, American Idiot, and 21st Century Breakdown as well as select songs from the rest of Green Day's discography. During the second leg of the 21st Century Breakdown World Tour the band had said that they are writing new material. In an interview with Kerrang! magazine, Armstrong spoke about the possible new album: \"We did some demos in Berlin, some in Stockholm, some just outside of Glasgow and some in Amsterdam. We wanted get the songs down in some early form.\" The band also stated that they were recording a live album during the entire tour on the last date of the tour in Mountain View, California, also before playing the song \"Cigarettes and Valentines\". In October 2010, Dirnt was interviewed by Radio W, mentioning that they have completed the writing process of the ninth studio album. In the interview, Dirnt also mentioned that a new live album will \"most likely\" be released. The live CD/DVD and CD/Blu-ray entitled Awesome as Fuck was released on March 22, 2011. \n\n¬°Uno!, ¬°Dos!, and ¬°Tr√©! (2011-present):\nOn August 11, 2011, Green Day played a secret show in Costa Mesa, California, and performed an entire set of over 15 new songs allegedly for a possible upcoming album. Green Day put a news post on their official website which read \"Thanks everyone for coming out to the show...\" and \"Stay tuned for more\". It also included lyrics to a new song that was played at the show called \"Amy\" which is dedicated to Amy Winehouse, who died weeks before the show. In February 2012, Armstrong announced through Twitter that the band were in the studio, recording material for a new album. On February 24, 2012, the band began uploading behind the scenes videos of the recording of the new album to YouTube. On April 11, singer Billie Joe Armstrong announced that Green Day would be releasing a trilogy of albums called ¬°Uno!, ¬°Dos!, and ¬°Tr√©!. Armstrong stated that they would be released on September 25, 2012, November 13, 2012, and January 15, 2013 respectively. On June 14, 2012, Green Day released the official artwork of the album ¬°Uno! on YouTube and Facebook. Armstrong in a talk with Rolling Stone Magazine confirmed that each album will have a member of the band on its cover. The ¬°Uno! ¬°Dos! ¬°Tr√©! Ultimate Box Set has also been announced by Warner Bros. Records and will contain all three albums, as well as various other content, such as three digital singles and a one year online membership or renewal to the Idiot Club. The band played at the Rock En Seine festival in France on August 24-26, 2012, the Rock am See festival in Germany on September 1, 2012 and the Reading festival in the UK. The band has also announced a US tour supporting the trilogy, from November 2012 through February 2013. ¬°Uno! was released on September 24, 2012 and has been met with generally favorable reviews. \n\nMusical style and influences:\n\nGreen Day's sound is often compared to first wave punk bands such as the Ramones, The Clash, Sex Pistols, and the Buzzcocks. Citing the band's musical style prevalent on Dookie, Stephen Erlewine of Allmusic described Green Day as \"punk revivalists who recharged the energy of speedy, catchy three-chord punk-pop songs.\" While Armstrong is the primary songwriter, he looks to the other band members for organizational help. Billie Joe Armstrong has mentioned that some of his biggest influences are seminal alternative rock bands H√ºsker D√º and The Replacements, and that their influence is particularly noted in the band's chord changes in songs. Green Day has covered H√ºsker D√º's \"Don't Want to Know If You Are Lonely\" as a b-side to the \"Warning\" single, and the character \"Mr. Whirly\" in their song \"Misery\" is a reference to the Replacements song of the same name. Among other influences, Green Day have also cited The Who and power pop pioneers Cheap Trick. The band has generated controversy over whether the band's musical style and major-label status constitutes as \"true punk\". In reaction to both the style of music and the background of the band, John Lydon, former front man of the 1970s punk band the Sex Pistols commented: \n\"So there we are fending off all that and it pisses me off that years later a wank outfit like Green Day hop in and nick all that and attach it to themselves. They didn't earn their wings to do that and if they were true punk they wouldn't look anything like they do.\" \nArmstrong himself has discussed the group's status of being a punk band on a major record label, saying \"Sometimes I think we've become totally redundant because we're this big band now, we've made a lot of money - we're not punk rock any more. But then I think about it and just say, 'You can take us out of a punk rock environment, but you can't take the punk rock out of us.'\" English rock musician Noel Gallagher of Oasis also complained about the band semi-jokingly, claiming that they ripped off his song \"Wonderwall\" with their song \"Boulevard of Broken Dreams\". \n\nRelated projects:\nSince 1991, members of the band have branched out past Green Day and have started other projects with other musicians. Notable related projects of Green Day include Billie Joe Armstrong's Pinhead Gunpowder (which also features Green Day's live back-up guitarist Jason White), The Frustrators in which Mike Dirnt plays bass, and The Network, a collaboration between Green Day and members of the band, Devo in which all members play under fake stage names. Green Day has also released an album titled Stop Drop and Roll!!! on May 20, 2008, under the name Foxboro Hot Tubs, they currently use this name to book secret shows. In late December 2011, Armstrong formed a new side band called The Boo along his wife Adrienne and their two sons. In September 2006, Green Day collaborated with U2 and producer Rick Rubin to record a cover of the song \"The Saints Are Coming\", originally recorded by The Skids, with an accompanying video. The song was recorded to benefit Music Rising, an organization to help raise money for musicians' instruments lost during Hurricane Katrina, and to bring awareness on the eve of the one year anniversary of the disaster. In December 2006, Green Day and NRDC opened a web site in partnership to raise awareness on America's dependency on oil. Green Day released a cover of the John Lennon song \"Working Class Hero\", which was featured on the album Instant Karma: The Amnesty International Campaign to Save Darfur. The band performed the song on the season finale of American Idol. The song was nominated for a Grammy Award in 2008, though lost to The White Stripes' \"Icky Thump\". That summer, the band appeared in a cameo role in The Simpsons Movie, where they perform the show's theme song. Their version was released as a single on July 24, 2007. In 2009, the band collaborated with theatre director Michael Mayer to adapt their rock opera American Idiot into a one-act stage musical that premiered at the Berkeley Rep on September 15, 2009. The show then moved to Broadway on April 20, 2010. The reviews of American Idiot: The Musical have been positive to mixed. Charles Isherwood of The New York Times wrote an enthusiastic review for the Broadway production. He called the show \"a pulsating portrait of wasted youth that invokes all the standard genre conventions ... only to transcend them through the power of its music and the artistry of its execution, the show is as invigorating and ultimately as moving as anything I've seen on Broadway this season. Or maybe for a few seasons past.\" Jed Gottlieb of the Boston Herald enjoyed the premise of the show but found that \"the music and message suffer in a setting where the audience is politely, soberly seated\". Michael Kuchiwara of the Associated Press found the show to be \"visually striking and musically adventurous\", but noted that \"the show has the barest wisp of a story and minimal character development\". Paul Kolnik in USA Today enjoyed the contradiction that Green Day's \"massively popular, starkly disenchanted album ... would be the feel-good musical of the season\". Time magazine's Richard Zoglin opined that the score \"is as pure a specimen of contemporary punk rock as Broadway has yet encountered yet there's enough variety. ... Where the show fall short is as a fully developed narrative.\" He concluded that \"American Idiot, despite its earnest huffing and puffing, remains little more than an annotated rock concert. ... Still, it deserves at least two cheers - for its irresistible musical energy and for opening fresh vistas for that odd couple, rock and Broadway.\" Peter Travers from Rolling Stone, in his review of American Idiot, wrote \"Though American Idiot carries echoes of such rock musicals as Tommy, Hair, Rent and Spring Awakening, it cuts its own path to the heart. You won't know what hit you. American Idiot knows no limits--it's a global knockout.\" The musical has been nominated for a number of Tony Awards, including Best Musical and Best Scenic Design. It was also nominated for a number of Drama Desk Awards and Outer Critics Circle Awards. In October 2009, a Green Day art project was exhibited at StolenSpace Gallery in London. The exhibition showed artworks created for each of the songs on 21st Century Breakdown, was supported by the band, and led by their manager Pat Magnarella. He explained in an interview that \"Artists are basically like rock bands. Most are creating their art, but don't know how to promote it.\" For Billie Joe Armstrong, \"Many of the artists... show their work on the street, and we feel a strong connection to that type of creative expression.\" On April 13, 2011, a film version of American Idiot was confirmed. Michael Mayer, director of the Broadway musical, will be directing the film. It will be produced by Green Day, Pat Magnarella (Green Day's manager who also produced Bullet in a Bible, Awesome as Fuck, and Heart Like a Hand Grenade), Playtone (Tom Hanks and Gary Goetzman) and Tom Hulce. \n\nInvolvement in politics and social justice:\nWhen asked his opinion regarding whether all musicians ought to try to add a social or political message to their work, Armstrong replied that \" \nThe only people who should sing about social issues or politics are the ones who aren't full of shit. \n\" \n American Idiot was released two months before former President of the United States George W. Bush was reelected, and as a result the album became protest art. Created as an anti-war album, American Idiot contains many new-age protest songs, like Holiday which was against George Bush's decision to invade Iraq. Armstrong described the song as a means by which \"to battle your way out of your own ignorance\". \n\nBand members:\n\nCurrent members \nBillie Joe Armstrong - lead vocals, guitar, piano, harmonica (1987-present), \nMike Dirnt - bass, backing vocals (1988-present), rhythm guitar (1987-1988), \nTr√© Cool - drums, percussion, backing vocals (1990-present), \nSession and touring members \nJason White - lead and rhythm guitars, backing vocals (1999-present), \nJason Freese - keyboards, piano, saxophone, trombone, backing vocals (2003-present), \nJeff Matika - rhythm guitar, acoustic guitar, backing vocals (2009-present), \n\nFormer members \nJohn Kiffmeyer - drums, percussion (1987-1990), \nSean Hughes - bass (1987-1988), \nFormer touring members \nTimmy Chunks - guitars (1997-1999), \nGarth Schultz - trombone, trumpet (1997-1999), \nGabrial McNair - trombone, tenor saxophone (1999-2001), \nJeanne Geiger - trombone (2001), \nKurt Lohmiller - trumpet, timpani, percussion, backing vocals (1999-2004), \nMike Pelino - rhythm guitar, backing vocals (2004-2005), \nRonnie Blake - trumpet, timpani, percussion, backing vocals (2004-2005)",

"text": "Green Day is an American rock trio formed in 1987. The band has consisted of Billie Joe Armstrong (vocals, guitar), Mike Dirnt (bass guitar, vocals), and Tr√© Cool (drums, percussion) for the majority of its existence.  Green Day was originally part of the punk rock scene at 924 Gilman Street, Berkeley in  East Bay, CA, United States . Its early releases for independent record label Lookout! Records earned them a grassroots fanbase, some of whom felt alienated when the band signed to a major label. Nevertheless, its major label debut Dookie (1994) became a breakout success and eventually sold over 10 million copies in the US. and 15 million worldwide. As a result, Green Day was widely credited, alongside fellow California punk bands The Offspring and Rancid, with reviving mainstream interest in and popularizing punk rock in the United States. Green Day's three follow-up albums, Insomniac, Nimrod and Warning did not achieve the massive success of Dookie, but they were still successful, reaching double platinum, double platinum, and gold status respectively. Green Day's 2004 rock opera American Idiot reignited the band's popularity with a younger generation, selling five million copies in the U.S.The band's eighth studio album, 21st Century Breakdown, was released on May 15, 2009.  Green Day has sold over 22 million records in the United States.They have won three Grammy Awards; Best Alternative Album for Dookie, Best Rock Album for American Idiot, and Record of the Year for Boulevard of Broken Dreams.  In 1987, friends Billie Joe Armstrong and Mike Dirnt, 15 years old at the time, formed a band called Sweet Children. The first Sweet Children show took place on October 17, 1987, at Rod's Hickory Pit in Vallejo, California where Armstrong's mother was working.In 1988, Armstrong and Dirnt began working with former Isocracy drummer, John Kiffmeyer (also known as Al Sobrante). Kiffmeyer served as both the band's drummer and business manager, handling the booking of shows and helping the band establish a fan base.  Larry Livermore, owner of Lookout! Records, saw the band play an early show and signed them to his label. In 1989 they recorded their first EP, 1,000 Hours. Before 1,000 Hours was released, the band dropped the name Sweet Children, according to Livermore this was done in order to avoid confusion with another local band Sweet Baby.The band adopted the name Green Day, allegedly due to their fondness of marijuana.  Lookout! would release Green Day's first LP, 39/Smooth in early 1990. Green Day would record two EPs later that year: Slappy and Sweet Children, the latter of which included some older songs they had recorded for Minneapolis indie label Skene! Records. In 1991, Lookout! Records released 1,039/Smoothed Out Slappy Hours, a compilation of the 39/Smooth, Slappy, and 1,000 Hours EPs. In late 1990, shortly after the band's first nationwide tour, Sobrante left the East Bay area to attend college. The Lookouts drummer Tr√© Cool began filling in as a temporary replacement, and when it became clear that Sobrante did not plan on committing to the band full time, Tr√© Cool's position as Green Day's drummer became permanent. The band went on tour for most of 1992 and 1993, and played a stretch of shows overseas in Europe. The band's second full length album Kerplunk sold about 50,000 copies in the U.S., which was considered quite a large amount for the independent punk scene in 1992.  Kerplunk's underground success led to a wave of interest coming from major record labels, and eventually they left Lookout! on friendly terms and signed with Reprise Records after attracting the attention of producer Rob Cavallo. Signing to Reprise caused many punk rock fans to regard Green Day as sellouts.Reflecting on the period, Armstrong told SPIN magazine in 1999, \"I couldn't go back to the punk scene, whether we were the biggest success in the world or the biggest failure ... The only thing I could do was get on my bike and go forward.\" After signing with Reprise, the band went to work on recording its major label debut, Dookie.  \"Longview\" Play sound Sample of \"Longview\", the first single from Dookie, which combined a memorable bass line with a guitar riff and drums introduced in the chorus. Problems listening to this file? See media help.  \"Basket Case\" Play sound Sample of \"Basket Case\", the third single from Dookie, which was about Armstrong's panic attacks. Problems listening to this file? See media help.  Released in February 1994, and recorded in 3 weeks,Dookie became a commercial success, helped by extensive MTV airplay for the videos of the songs \"Longview\", \"Basket Case\", and \"When I Come Around\", all of which reached the number one position on the Modern Rock Tracks charts. That year, Green Day embarked on a nationwide tour with queercore band Pansy Division as its opening act. At a September 9, 1994 concert at Boston Esplanade, mayhem broke-out during the band's set (cut short to seven songs) and by the end of the rampage, 100 people were injured and 45 arrested. The band also joined the lineups of both the Lollapalooza festival and Woodstock 1994, where they started an infamous mud fight. During the concert, a security guard mistook bassist Mike Dirnt for a stage-invading fan and punched out some of his teeth. Viewed by millions via pay-per-view television, the Woodstock 1994 performance further aided Green Day's growing publicity and recognition, and helped push its album to eventual diamond status. In 1995, Dookie won the Grammy Award for Best Alternative Album and the band was nominated for 9 MTV Video Music Awards including Video of the Year. The full fold-out artwork to Insomniac, entitled God Told Me to Skin You Alive.  In 1995, a new single for the Angus soundtrack was released, titled \"J.A.R.\". The single went straight to number one on the Billboard Modern Rock Tracks chart. The song was followed by the band's new album, Insomniac, which was released in the fall of 1995. Insomniac was a much darker and heavier response by the band, compared to the poppier, more melodic Dookie. Insomniac opened to a warm critical reception, earning 4 out of 5 stars from Rolling Stone, which said \"In punk, the good stuff actually unfolds and gains meaning as you listen without sacrificing any of its electric, haywire immediacy. And Green Day are as good as this stuff gets.\"Insomniac used a piece of art by Winston Smith entitled God Told Me to Skin You Alive for its album cover. The singles released from Insomniac were \"Geek Stink Breath\", \"Brain Stew/Jaded\", \"Walking Contradiction\", and \"Stuck With Me\". Though the album did not approach the success of Dookie, it still sold two million copies in the United States.Insomniac won the band award nominations for Favorite Artist, Favorite Hard Rock Artist, and Favorite Alternative Artist at the 1996 American Music Awards, and the video for \"Walking Contradiction\" got the band a Grammy nomination for Best Video, Short Form, in addition to a Best Special Effects nomination at the MTV Video Music Awards.[20] After that, the band abruptly cancelled a European tour, citing exhaustion.  Middle era: 1997-2002  After taking a break in 1996, Green Day began to work on a new album in 1997. From the outset, both the band and Cavallo agreed that the album had to be different from its previous records.The result was Nimrod, an experimental deviation from the band's standard pop-punk brand of music. The new album was released in October 1997. It provided a variety of music, from pop-punk, surf rock, and ska, to an acoustic ballad. Nimrod entered the charts at number 10. The success of \"Good Riddance (Time of Your Life)\" won the band an MTV Video Award for Best Alternative Video for the song's video, which depicted people undergoing major changes in their lives while Billie Joe Armstrong strummed his acoustic guitar. The song was also used in the second \"clip show\" episode of Seinfeld and on two episodes of ER. The other singles released from Nimrod were \"Nice Guys Finish Last\", \"Hitchin' a Ride\" and \"Redundant\". The band made a guest appearance in an episode of King of the Hill entitled \"The Man Who Shot Cane Skretteberg\", which aired in 1997.  In 2000, Green Day released Warning, a step further in the style that they had hinted at with Nimrod. Critics' reviews of the album were varied.Allmusic gave it 4.5/5 saying \"Warning may not be an innovative record per se, but it's tremendously satisfying.\" Rolling Stone was more critical, giving it 3/5, and saying \"Warning... invites the question: Who wants to listen to songs of faith, hope and social commentary from what used to be snot-core's biggest-selling band?\" Though it produced the hit \"Minority\" and a smaller hit with \"Warning\", some observers were coming to the conclusion that the band was losing relevance,and a decline in popularity followed. While all of Green Day's past albums had reached a status of at least double platinum, Warning was only certified gold.  At the 2001 California Music Awards, Green Day won all eight awards that they were nominated for. They won the awards for Outstanding Album (Warning), Outstanding Punk Rock/Ska Album (Warning), Outstanding Group, Outstanding Male Vocalist, Outstanding Bassist, Outstanding Drummer, Outstanding Songwriter and Outstanding Artist  The release of a Greatest Hits compilation, International Superhits!, and an assemblage of B-sides, Shenanigans, followed Warning. International Superhits and its companion collection of music videos, International Supervideos!, sold reasonably well, going platinum in the U.S. Shenanigans contained some of the band's b-sides, including \"Espionage\" which was featured in Austin Powers: The Spy Who Shagged Me and was nominated for a Grammy for Best Rock Instrumental Performance.  In the spring of 2002, Green Day co-headlined the Pop Disaster Tour with Blink-182. Despite the co-headlining title, Green Day would play each show before Blink-182, who at the time were experiencing more success. The tour was documented on the DVD Riding In Vans With Boys.  American Idiot and renewed popularity: 2003-2006 Spectators watch Green Day from the grass slopes at the National Bowl.  In the summer of 2003 the band went into a studio to write and record new material for a new album, tentatively titled Cigarettes and Valentines. After completing 20 tracks, the master tapes were stolen from the studio. The band chose not to try to re-create the stolen album, but instead started over. By the end of 2003, Green Day collaborated with Iggy Pop on two tracks for his album Skull Ring. On February 1, 2004 a new song, a cover of \"I Fought the Law\" made its debut on a commercial for iTunes during NFL Super Bowl XXXVIII. The band underwent serious \"band therapy,\" engaging in several long talks to work out the members' differences after accusations from Dirnt and Cool that Armstrong was \"the band's Nazi\" and a show-off bent on taking the limelight from the other band members.  The resulting 2004 album, American Idiot, debuted at number one on the Billboard charts, the band's first ever album to top the chart, backed by the success of the album's first single, \"American Idiot.\" The album was billed as a \"punk rock opera\" which follows the journey of the fictitious \"Jesus of Suburbia\". American Idiot won the 2005 Grammy for \"Best Rock Album\" and the band swept the 2005 MTV music awards, winning a total of seven of the eight awards they were nominated for, including the coveted Viewer's Choice Award.  Through 2005, the band toured in support of the album with about 150 dates -- the longest tour in its career -- visiting Japan, Australia, South America and the United Kingdom, where they drew a crowd of 130,000 people over a span of two days. While touring for American Idiot, they filmed and recorded the two concerts at the Milton Keynes National Bowl in England, which was voted 'The Best Show On Earth' in a Kerrang! Magazine Poll.  These recordings were released as a live CD and DVD called Bullet in a Bible on November 15, 2005. This CD/DVD featured hits from American Idiot as well as a few songs from all its previous albums, except \"Kerplunk\" and \"1,039/Smoothed Out Slappy Hours\". The DVD featured behind-the-scenes footage of the band, and showed how the band prepared to put on the show. The final shows of its 2005 world tour were in Sydney, Australia, and Melbourne, Australia, on December 14 and 17 respectively. On January 10, 2006 the band was awarded with a People's Choice Award for favorite group. Green Day live in Germany during the American Idiot tour.  On August 1, 2005, Green Day announced that that it had rescinded the master rights to its pre-Dookie material from Lookout! Records, citing a continuing breach of contract regarding unpaid royalties, a complaint shared with other Lookout! bands. The pre-Dookie material, which remained out of print for about a year, was reissued by the band's current label, Reprise, on January 9, 2007.  In 2006, Green Day won the Grammy Award for Record of the Year for \"Boulevard of Broken Dreams\" which spent 16 weeks at the number one position of Billboard's Modern Rock Tracks, a record it shared along with Red Hot Chili Peppers' \"Scar Tissue\" and Staind's \"It's Been Awhile,\" (the record has been since been beaten by Foo Fighters' 2007 hit \"The Pretender\" which reigned at the top spot for 18 weeks).  Foxboro Hot Tubs and 21st Century Breakdown: 2007 onward  Green Day engaged in several other smaller projects in the time following the hype of American Idiot. In the spring of 2007, Green Day recorded a cover of the John Lennon song \"Working Class Hero\", which appeared on a compilation album \"Instant Karma\", that benefitted victims in Darfur. In the summer of 2007, Green Day recorded a version of The Simpsons theme song for The Simpsons Movie, as well as having an appearance in the movie.  Green Day recently released a new album under the name Foxboro Hot Tubs entitled Stop Drop and Roll!!!. In an interview with Kerrang!, Billie Joe revealed that 2008 would \"be a fair estimate of the release date of their new untitled eighth studio album.\"In a recent interview with Carson Daly, Garbage lead singer Shirley Manson revealed that Butch Vig would be producing Green Day's forthcoming album. In October 2008 Green Day returned to the studios with Butch Vig, to start recording the new studio album. Two videos showing the band in the studio were posted on YouTube. In the tour section of the band's official website, the message \"World Tour coming soon!\" is shown.In the December 9 issue of Alternative Press, in-depth details about the new album were released. According to the interview, Green Day are recording in the same studio as they did for American Idiot, Ocean Way Recording in Hollywood, California. \"This album is more... religious\", and is influenced by Bob Dylan, Bruce Springsteen, and The Beatles, to name a few.Billie Joe Armstrong said when he was being interviewed for Kerrang!'s readers poll, that it will be more power pop than punk rock.The new album is titled 21st Century Breakdown and was released worldwide on May 15, 2009. Green Day will be going on a world tour starting with North America in July, 2009 until sometime in 2010. Singles from 21st Century Breakdown include Know Your Enemy and 21 Guns.  Musical style and influences  Green Day's sound is often compared to first wave punk bands such as the Ramones, The Clash, Sex Pistols, The Jam, and the Buzzcocks. The majority of their song catalog is composed of distorted guitar, fast, manic drums, and relatively high-treble bass. Most of their songs are fast-paced and under four minutes. Billie Joe Armstrong has mentioned that some of his biggest influences are seminal alternative rock bands H√ºsker D√º and The Replacements, and that their influence is particularly noted in the band's chord changes in songs. In fact, Green Day has covered H√ºsker D√º's \"Don't Want to Know If You Are Lonely\" as a b-side for the \"Warning\" single, and the character \"Mr. Whirly\" in their song \"Misery\" is a reference to the Replacements song of the same name. Among other influences, Green Day have also cited Queen,proto-punks The Who, and power pop pioneers Cheap Trick [46]. Armstrong's lyrics commonly describe alienation, (\"Jesus of Suburbia\", \"Boulevard of Broken Dreams\", \"Road to Acceptance\", \"Disappearing Boy\", \"Castaway\") hysteria (\"Basket Case\", \"Panic Song\"), girls (\"She\", \"80\" \"Only of You\",\"Maria\" \"She's a Rebel\"), growing up (\"Longview\" and \"Welcome to Paradise\"), and the effects of doing drugs (\"Geek Stink Breath\", \"Green Day\"). The Ramones had similar lyrical themes such as hysteria (\"Anxiety\", \"Psycho Therapy\"), alienation (\"Outsider\", \"Something To Believe In\"), girls (\"I Wanna Be Your Boyfriend\", \"Sheena Is a Punk Rocker\"), and drugs (\"Now I Wanna Sniff Some Glue\", \"Chinese Rocks\"). Green Day has covered Ramones songs several times, including recording \"Outsider\" for the tribute album We're a Happy Family, and performing \"Blitzkrieg Bop\" and \"Teenage Lobotomy\" when the Ramones were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2002.  Criticism and controversy  Beginning with the release of Dookie, and the subsequent explosion of MTV airplay it received, Green Day has received considerable criticism from those who see the punk genre as a social movement independent of corporate sponsorship. With the release of American Idiot and the subsequent draw of many new fans, much of this criticism has been revived.  One of the more contentious issues is genre labeling. In reaction to both the style of music and the background of the band, many fans and musicians have taken heavy objection to the usage of the term \"punk\" when applied to Green Day. This is evidenced by the following comments issued by John Lydon (Johnny Rotten), former front man of both the 1970s punk band the Sex Pistols and the 1980s post-punk, Public Image Ltd.: \" So there we are fending off all that and it pisses me off that years later a wank outfit like Green Day hop in and nick all that and attach it to themselves. They didn't earn their wings to do that and if they were true punk they wouldn't look anything like they do. \"  Brandon Flowers of The Killers went on record in 2007 claiming that Green Day's politically driven concept album American Idiot displays \"calculated Anti-Americanism.\" He explained that he has problems with the album content itself and also the fact that the band's recent live DVD, Bullet in a Bible, was filmed in England. The taping of the concert, featured on Bullet in a Bible, shows thousands of Europeans singing along to \"American Idiot.\" Stating that he felt Green Day's DVD is a bit of a stunt, he said, \"I just thought it was really cheap. To go to a place like England or Germany and sing that song - those kids aren't taking it the same way that he meant it. And he (Billie Joe Armstrong) knew it.\"  More recently, Oasis guitarist Noel Gallagher has accused the band of ripping off his song \"Wonderwall\" for \"Boulevard of Broken Dreams\".  Related projects Main article: Green Day related projects  Ever since 1991, some members of the band have branched out past Green Day and have started other projects with other musicians. Notable related projects of Green Day include Billie Joe Armstrong's Pinhead Gunpowder (which also features Green Day's live backup guitarist Jason White), The Frustrators in which Mike Dirnt plays bass, and The Network, in which all three members of Green Day play under fake stage names. Billie Joe Armstrong has also confirmed that the main members of Green Day are in the band Foxboro Hot Tubs. A Foxboro Hot Tubs album titled Stop Drop and Roll!!! was released on 2008-05-20.  Charity projects that the band have been involved with include the collaboration with U2 (\"The Saints Are Coming\") to help raise money for musical instruments lost in Hurricane Katrina, and teaming with the Natural Resources Defense Council for the \"Move America Beyond Oil\" campaign and other environmental concerns.  In September 2006, Green Day teamed up with U2 and producer Rick Rubin to record a cover of the song \"The Saints Are Coming\", originally recorded by The Skids, with an accompanying video. The song is to benefit Music Rising, an organization to help raise money for musicians' instruments lost during Hurricane Katrina, and to bring awareness on the eve of the one year anniversary of the disaster.  \"Working Class Hero\" Play sound \"Working Class Hero\", a cover of a John Lennon song, was released on the Instant Karma CD.
